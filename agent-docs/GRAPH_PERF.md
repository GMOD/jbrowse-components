## Performance

**Surgical node dragging in `plugins/graph`.** Currently, moving a single node
triggers a full `buildGeometry` and `uploadGeometry` for the entire graph
(all nodes and edges) via the `viewportDirty` flag.
- *Optimization:* Implement `updateSubBatchGeometry` in `GraphRenderer`
  backends to allow partial buffer updates.
- *Action:* Update `moveNode` to only re-tessellate the dragged node and
  its connected edges, then push only those vertex slices to the GPU.
- *Prerequisite:* Demonstrate slowness with a large graph example (e.g.,
  10k+ nodes) using the added `[Graph Performance]` console logging.

**`chainIdMap` perf.** Gate to `linkedRead + chain highlights active`.
Currently iterates every read × region on every data update.
