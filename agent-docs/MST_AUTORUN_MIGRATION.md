# GPU Display MST-Driven Autorun Migration

**Status:** 9 of ~9 display types migrated (dotplot/synteny still pending).
Branch: `webgl-poc`. **Last commits:** `626cb1` (wiggle + canvas), `ff7f03`
(HiC + LD + variant-matrix), alignments + regular variants + util generalization
(pending commit).

This document serializes state for a fresh agent to continue the work. Read
`agent-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` first for the overall GPU rendering architecture
(but note it's still mostly pre-refactor — updating it is tier 4 of this plan).

---

## Motivation

Before this refactor, every GPU display's React component reimplemented the same
upload/prune/render dance inline: a `useEffect`-wrapped `autorun`, a
`lastDataMap` / `lastUploaded` ref pair, an explicit `model.dataVersion` read
for the sync point, plus `uploadChangedRegions` + `pruneRegions` wiring. Subtle
correctness invariants (when to use `dataVersion` vs. map-identity; when to use
`useLayoutEffect` vs. `autorun`) lived in 8 copy-pasted call sites that had
already drifted.

The refactor hoists the lifecycle into the MST display model via a shared
utility, making React components thin bridges that only pass the canvas and the
backend to the model. "Tricky correctness" concentrates in one tested utility
rather than fanning out across plugins.

## New shared primitives (in `packages/core/src/gpu/`)

### `startGpuBackendAutorunLifecycle`

Multi-region family. Runs two independent autoruns:

- **Upload autorun** iterates one or more `uploadStreams`, each with its own
  identity-diff cache. Per-stream options:
  - `getDataByRegionNumber(): Map<number, RegionData>`
  - `uploadOneRegion(backend, n, data)`
  - `pruneRegionsNotIn?(backend, active)` — optional, streams that share a
    backend's per-region slots can omit (e.g. alignments arcs share pileup's
    slots).
  - `identityOf?(data): unknown` — compares identity between passes. Defaults to
    reference equality. Use when data entries are replaced wholesale on every
    observable change (e.g. `inputKey` hash for variants).
  - `getUploadInvalidationToken?(): unknown` — bump to force full re-upload of
    the stream.
- **Render autorun** reads `getRenderBlocks()`, `getRenderState()`, and an
  observable upload-signal bumped whenever the upload autorun uploaded anything.
  Render-state-only changes (e.g. hover highlight IDs) re-fire only this autorun
  — the upload cache walk is skipped.

Single-stream sugar: if `uploadStreams` is omitted, top-level
`getDataByRegionNumber`/`uploadOneRegion`/`pruneRegionsNotIn`/`identityOf`/
`getUploadInvalidationToken` are treated as one stream.

Returns `{ dispose, renderNow }`. `renderNow` re-issues the last render with
cached blocks + state, for non-MobX triggers (tab visibility, DOM scroll).

10 passing unit tests in
`packages/core/src/gpu/startGpuBackendAutorunLifecycle.test.ts` (including
`uploadStreams`, `identityOf`, and upload/render split coverage).

### `startGpuSingleDataBackendAutorunLifecycle`

Global-upload family (HiC, LD, variant-matrix). Takes an array of `uploadSlots`,
each with `{ readData, commitUpload }` — each slot is identity-diffed
independently so plugins like HiC (data + color ramp) can track each upload
separately without re-uploading on any unrelated change. Renders only once all
slots have data.

6 passing unit tests.

### `GpuBackendLifecycleSlotMixin`

Small MST mixin every GPU display composes. Provides:

- `volatile gpuBackendLifecycleHandle` slot
- `assignGpuBackendLifecycleHandle(handle)` action — disposes any previous
  handle, then assigns
- `stopGpuBackendLifecycle()` action
- `renderNow()` action

Plugins only need to write one method — `startGpuBackendLifecycle(backend)` —
that calls
`self.assignGpuBackendLifecycleHandle(startGpu…AutorunLifecycle({…}))`.

### Hoisted to `MultiRegionDisplayMixin`

- Cached `renderBlocks` getter = `buildRenderBlocks(view.visibleRegions)`. Every
  LGV-based GPU display inherits it — a plugin that needs to suppress rendering
  in some state (e.g. no domain yet) does that in the autorun's
  `getRenderBlocks` callback (`() => self.domain ? self.renderBlocks : []`), not
  by overriding the getter.
- Upload-identity contract documented on `setLoadedRegionForRegion`: per-region
  value objects must be freshly constructed when updated — never mutated in
  place — since the autorun's identity diff depends on reference inequality.

## Per-plugin pattern

**Model (~25–50 lines added):**

```ts
types
  .compose(
    'MyDisplay',
    BaseDisplay,
    TrackHeightMixin(),
    MultiRegionDisplayMixin(),
    ConfigOverrideMixin(),
    GpuBackendLifecycleSlotMixin(), // ← added
    types.model({
      /* props */
    }),
  )
  .views(self => ({
    get renderState() {
      const view = getContainingView(self) as LGV
      return {
        /* plugin-specific fields */
      }
    },
    // renderBlocks inherited from MultiRegionDisplayMixin
  }))
  .actions(self => ({
    startGpuBackendLifecycle(backend: MyBackend) {
      self.assignGpuBackendLifecycleHandle(
        startGpuBackendAutorunLifecycle<MyBackend, MyData, MyState>({
          backend,
          getDataByRegionNumber: () => self.rpcDataMap,
          getRenderBlocks: () => self.renderBlocks,
          getRenderState: () => self.renderState,
          uploadOneRegion: (b, n, d) => b.uploadRegion(n /*…*/),
          pruneRegionsNotIn: (b, active) => b.pruneRegions(active),
          renderAllBlocks: (b, blocks, state) => b.renderBlocks(blocks, state),
          onAfterCommit: hadUploads => {
            if (hadUploads) self.setCanvasDrawn(true)
          },
        }),
      )
    },
  }))
```

**React component (thin):**

```tsx
const { error, retry } = useGpuRenderer(canvasRef, MyRenderer, {
  onReady: backend => model.startGpuBackendLifecycle(backend),
  onDispose: () => model.stopGpuBackendLifecycle(),
})
useTabVisibilityRerender(() => model.renderNow())
```

Single-global family uses `startGpuSingleDataBackendAutorunLifecycle` with a
list of `uploadSlots` instead of `uploadOneRegion` / `pruneRegionsNotIn`.

**Tsc clean** for every plugin above after every step. Tests were not run (user
preference: tsc is enough; jest is slow and many existing failures are
pre-existing). 193 `packages/core/src/gpu` tests pass, including the new utility
tests.

---

## Remaining work (ordered by priority)

### Tier 1 — finish migrations

**1. Alignments — biggest remaining case.**

- `plugins/alignments/src/LinearAlignmentsDisplay/model.ts` +
  `components/useAlignmentsBase.ts` / wherever the renderer is wired
- Backend: `AlignmentsBackend` in `components/rendererTypes.ts:152-165` has
  three extra public methods beyond the multi-region contract:
  `uploadArcsFromTypedArraysForRegion`, `uploadConnectingLinesForRegion`.
- **Recommended reshape:** fold arcs + connecting lines into `PileupDataResult`,
  then `uploadOneRegion(b, n, data)` dispatches internally:
  ```ts
  uploadOneRegion: (b, n, data) => {
    b.uploadRegion(n, data)
    if (data.arcs) b.uploadArcsFromTypedArraysForRegion(n, data.arcs)
    if (data.connectingLinePositions) b.uploadConnectingLinesForRegion(n, {…})
  }
  ```
  (Or keep the three methods and call all three from `uploadOneRegion`.)
- The model does `withFetchLifecycle` + layout computation on the main thread.
  Ensure `getUploadInvalidationToken` returns something that changes on layout
  recomputes (color scheme, featureHeight, showCoverage, etc. — see
  `AlignmentsBackend.renderBlocks(state: RenderState)` — 20+ fields in
  `RenderState` — some belong in render-state, some are upload-affecting).
- The component file is large (`useAlignmentsBase.ts`). Expect a ~100-line
  component slimming and a ~60-line model addition.

**2. Regular variants (MultiVariantDisplay pileup).**

- `plugins/variants/src/MultiVariantDisplay/model.ts` +
  `components/VariantComponent.tsx`
- Backend: `VariantBackend` in `components/variantBackendTypes.ts` — standard
  multi-region shape `uploadRegion(n, data)` / `pruneRegions` / `renderBlocks`.
- Compose `GpuBackendLifecycleSlotMixin()` at the pileup level (not in
  `MultiSampleVariantBaseModel` — that's shared with matrix, and matrix already
  has its own compose).
- Render state: `{ canvasWidth, canvasHeight, rowHeight, scrollTop }`. Similar
  to canvas — may want `scrollTop` in MST volatile.

**3. Dotplot + synteny (geometry-keyed).**

- These already use a model-owned backend pattern (renderer stored in MST
  volatile, onReady/onDispose callbacks). They are the closest to the target
  architecture.
- Backends differ from the multi-region shape
  (`{ resize, uploadGeometry(key), deleteGeometry(key), render(…positional args), dispose }`).
  The `startGpuBackendAutorunLifecycle` util assumes
  `uploadRegion`/`pruneRegions` naming. **Two options:**
  1. Keep dotplot/synteny's custom autorun, but adopt
     `GpuBackendLifecycleSlotMixin` for consistent `dispose` / `renderNow`.
     Minimal change, maximal consistency for the slot semantics.
  2. Generalize the multi-region util to accept a `uploadKey`/`deleteKey` naming
     override (adapter for `uploadGeometry`/`deleteGeometry`). More ambitious.
- Also normalize the `render(offsetX, offsetY, lineWidth, trackScales)` /
  `render(offset0, offset1, height, curBpPerPx0, curBpPerPx1, …)` positional
  signatures into a `render(state)` object (per architectural review — see the
  full review in conversation history, summarized below).

### Tier 2 — lock in correctness

**4. Backend conformance test suite.** Create
`packages/core/src/gpu/backendConformance.test.ts`. One
`describe.each(ALL_BACKENDS)` parameterized by `(name, factory)`. Cases:

- `dispose()` releases GPU buffers / contexts (count them via `MockHal`)
- Uploading the same object reference twice is a no-op on the second call
- `renderBlocks` / `render` before `ready` is a safe no-op
- `pruneRegions` removes buffers for absent keys
- Context-loss reinit produces equivalent output (golden image via MockHal is
  likely not feasible; assertion on draw call count + uniform values is)
- Every backend must register itself in `ALL_BACKENDS`.

The point is drift prevention — any plugin that adds a method or changes
semantics fails the shared suite rather than the failure showing up as a visual
bug later.

### Tier 3 — cleanup

**5. Delete `uploadChangedRegions` and `pruneRegionMap`.** After Tier 1
completes, no production code will import these. Delete. Search:
`grep -r 'uploadChangedRegions\|pruneRegionMap' packages/ plugins/`.

**6. Rename `regionNumber` → `displayedRegionIndex`.** ~550 occurrences across
73 files (documented in
`plugins/linear-genome-view/src/LinearGenomeView/model.ts:1460-1503` and
elsewhere). Do this in **one focused pass, last**, so we're not churning code
mid-migration. Scripted sed/Edit is fine; verify with tsc. Also touches:
`packages/core/src/util/blockTypes.ts`, `Base1DViewModel.ts`,
`calculateDynamicBlocks.ts`, `calculateStaticBlocks.ts`.

### Tier 4 — documentation

**7. Rewrite `agent-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect the new architecture.** The
current doc still describes the old React-effect-driven pattern. Replace the
"Upload/render lifecycle" and "Plugin-level Backend interfaces" sections with:
"Every display has a model that owns upload+render via an autorun; React
components are thin bridges; three utilities cover all display types
(`startGpuBackendAutorunLifecycle`, `startGpuSingleDataBackendAutorunLifecycle`,
`GpuBackendLifecycleSlotMixin`)."

Regenerate the "Adding a new GPU display type" section with the new pattern.

## Architectural review findings still outstanding

From the review earlier in the conversation, not yet acted on:

- **`render()` positional signatures** in dotplot (4 args) and synteny (10 args)
  should become `(state: object)` for extensibility. Part of Tier 1.3.
- **`regionKey` vs `regionNumber`** naming mismatch between dotplot and the
  rest. Fix during Tier 3.6 rename (consider whether dotplot's composite key
  should also rename, or stay distinct).
- **`pick(x, y)` on synteny** doesn't fit any family cleanly. Consider a
  separate `Pickable` mixin interface if picking spreads to other displays.
- **`?gpu=` vs `?renderer=` parameter mismatch** (the browser test helper uses
  `?gpu=` but code checks `?renderer=`). `agent-docs/TODO.md` tracks this. Small
  fix, orthogonal to the MST migration.

---

## User preferences (must honor)

From `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` plus stated during this refactor:

- **No explicit TS return types** — avoid `function foo(): T`. Let inference.
- **No `any` or typecasts** — reach for correctness. The one exception I used is
  `data as MatrixCellData` inside `commitUpload` — the util generic is `unknown`
  because multi-slot utils can't type each slot independently; see
  `startGpuSingleDataBackendAutorunLifecycle.ts`. Acceptable; flag if the next
  agent wants to generalize.
- **Don't destructure MST model functions** — call as `model.method()`, not
  `const { method } = model`.
- **Always wrap React components with `observer()`**.
- **Avoid `useMemo` / `useEffect` / refs** where MST cached getters + autoruns
  suffice. "You Might Not Need an Effect" applies aggressively here.
- **MST cached getters** are auto-memoized when observed — use them freely
  instead of React-side `useMemo`.
- **Don't comment what the code does** — only _why_, and only when non-obvious.
  Many comments added during this migration explain "why" (upload-identity
  contract, invalidation token rationale, MST self-visibility quirks). Keep
  those; don't add "what" comments.
- **Longer descriptive names welcome** when they prevent ambiguity.
- **Don't over-guard invariants in getters** — e.g. don't check
  `view.initialized` inside `renderBlocks`; treat view-initialized as a contract
  the caller must respect.
- **Run `tsc --noEmit`, not jest** — jest is slow and the existing suite has
  many pre-existing failures unrelated to this work.
- **Only commit when asked.** User explicitly asked twice during this session;
  don't auto-commit.
- **No `gh pr create` unless explicitly asked.**

## Key files to read when resuming

1. `packages/core/src/gpu/startGpuBackendAutorunLifecycle.ts` — the main util
2. `packages/core/src/gpu/startGpuSingleDataBackendAutorunLifecycle.ts` —
   sibling util
3. `packages/core/src/gpu/GpuBackendLifecycleSlotMixin.ts` — the MST mixin
4. `plugins/wiggle/src/LinearWiggleDisplay/model.ts` — simplest exemplar of the
   pattern
5. `plugins/hic/src/LinearHicDisplay/model.ts` — exemplar of multi-slot
   single-global use
6. `plugins/linear-genome-view/src/BaseLinearDisplay/models/MultiRegionDisplayMixin.ts`
   — shared `renderBlocks` getter + upload contract doc

When starting on alignments (tier 1.1), the current non-migrated structure lives
in
`plugins/alignments/src/LinearAlignmentsDisplay/components/useAlignmentsBase.ts`
and `rendererTypes.ts`. That's where the 3 upload methods live today.
