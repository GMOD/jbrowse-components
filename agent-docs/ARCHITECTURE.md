# Architecture

## Coordinate system

JBrowse uses **0-based half-open intervals** `[start, end)` internally for
all genomic features and regions. This matches BED/BAM convention. Adapters
that read 1-based formats (VCF `POS`, GFF `start`) subtract 1 on ingest;
exporters that write 1-based formats add 1 on output.

## Data fetching pipeline

`MultiRegionDisplayMixin` (in `plugins/linear-genome-view/src/BaseLinearDisplay/`)
drives RPC fetches for all LGV displays (alignments, canvas, wiggle,
variants) via four autoruns:

| Autorun | Trigger | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DisplayedRegionsChange` | `view.displayedRegions` change | `clearAllRpcData()` |
| `FetchVisibleRegions` | viewport / `fetchGeneration` (600ms debounce) | `fetchNeeded(needed)` for uncovered buffered regions; gated by `error`/`regionTooLarge` |
| `SettingsInvalidate` | `rpcProps` change | `clearAllRpcData()` |
| `ClearBlockingStateOnViewportChange` | viewport change while `regionTooLarge` or `error` is set | `clearAllRpcData()` to unblock retry (no-op for canvas's derived `regionTooLarge`) |

Subclasses override `fetchNeeded` to call `self.fetchRegions(needed, work)`,
where `fetchRegions` runs an optional pre-flight byte estimate
(via `getByteEstimateConfig`) before invoking the work callback. Oversize
regions surface a banner via `regionCannotBeRendered()`. `error`/`regionTooLarge`
reads in `ClearBlockingStateOnViewportChange` are `untracked` for correctness —
tracking either would let `set...` re-fire the autorun and wipe the flag
before any viewport change.

### regionTooLarge: imperative vs. derived

There are two implementations of `regionTooLarge` in the codebase, both
expressed through the `regionTooLarge` getter so consumers
(`regionCannotBeRendered()`, `regionCannotBeRenderedText()`, the
`FetchVisibleRegions` gate) work with either.

- **Imperative** (`RegionTooLargeMixin` default; used by wiggle, alignments,
  hic): `setRegionTooLarge(true)` flips a volatile flag inside `fetchRegions`
  when the byte estimate exceeds the limit. `ClearBlockingStateOnViewportChange`
  clears the flag on viewport change so `FetchVisibleRegions` can retry.
- **Derived** (canvas's `LinearCanvasBaseDisplay`): a pure function of cached
  stats × current `bpPerPx` + visible regions, mirroring `FeatureDensityMixin`.
  - `bytesEstimateTooLarge` reads `featureDensityStats.bytes` (set by the
    byte-estimate RPC) against `userByteSizeLimit ?? adapter limit ?? config`.
  - `densityTooLarge` walks `view.visibleRegions`, looks up
    `densityStatsPerRegion[idx]` (populated for both successful fetches and
    worker-side too-large responses), and tests
    `(featureCount/regionWidthBp) × bpPerPx > maxFeatureDensity`. Scoping to
    currently-visible regions means panning past too-large areas naturally
    releases the gate.
  - `regionTooLarge = bytesEstimateTooLarge || densityTooLarge`.
  - `laidOutDataMap` returns empty when `regionTooLarge` is true, so the GPU
    upload pushes nothing — no stale-feature flash through the banner.
  - `isCacheValid` keeps too-large regions cached while the threshold still
    trips at the current zoom; flips invalid (forces refetch) when it doesn't.
  - A canvas-level autorun on `view.displayedRegions` clears
    `densityStatsPerRegion`/`featureDensityStats` on chromosome navigation
    (`displayedRegionIndex` gets reused, so stale entries would otherwise gate
    against the wrong region's stats and could permanently block refetch).

The derived approach removes the imperative clear-and-reset cycle that caused
the banner to flicker off and back on during small zoom or pan moves that
didn't actually cross the threshold. Both `featureDensityStats` and
`densityStatsPerRegion` survive `clearAllRpcData()` (they aren't in
`clearDisplaySpecificData`'s clearing path), so
`ClearBlockingStateOnViewportChange` is a no-op for the derived banner —
state recomputes the same value before and after.

`regionCannotBeRendered()` and `regionCannotBeRenderedText()` in
`RegionTooLargeMixin` read through `self.regionTooLarge` (the getter) rather
than `self.regionTooLargeState` (the volatile) so subclass overrides flow
into the banner UI and SVG export text.

Variants are monolithic: `MultiSampleVariantGetCellData` returns one batched
payload covering all visible regions, so variants' `fetchNeeded` expands
`needed` to all `bufferedVisibleRegions` and marks them all loaded together
when the work callback returns.

### `rpcProps` loop trap and how to break it

Including any fetch-result derivative in `rpcProps` creates an infinite loop:

```
setCellData → <derived value> changes → rpcProps changes
  → SettingsInvalidate → clearAllRpcData → cellData cleared
  → <derived value> changes → rpcProps changes → …
```

The fix is to split the computation: `rpcProps` gets a cache-key version
computed from user-controlled inputs only; any part that needs fetch-result
data is kept in a separate view used only for rendering or passed directly
to the server.

In the variant case, `rpcProps.sources` calls `getSources` with
`renderingMode: 'alleleCount'` internally so haplotype expansion (which
needs `sampleInfo`) is never triggered. The client's `sources` view still
reads `sampleInfo` for rendering — safe because it is not in `rpcProps`.
The server receives the unexpanded sources and expands them after computing
`sampleInfo` from features; sources from clustering already carry `HP` and
pass through unchanged.

**Rule**: `rpcProps` must contain only user-controlled settings. Never
include `cellData`, `sampleInfo`, or any getter that reads them.

See `plugins/linear-genome-view/src/BaseLinearDisplay/CLAUDE.md` for the
overridable hook list and test-file mapping.

# GPU Rendering Architecture

Canonical reference for the GPU rendering lifecycle across all display types.
Read `PRD.md` first for invariants and active priorities.

## Glossary

- HAL — hardware abstraction layer; abstracts WebGL2 and WebGPU calls.

---

## One-liner

Each GPU display is an MST model that composes `GpuBackendLifecycleSlotMixin`
and calls `self.installGpuDisplay(backend, { upload, render })` in its
`startGpuBackendLifecycle(backend)` action. The mixin spawns two autoruns tied
to the model's lifetime — one that runs `upload(backend)`, one that runs
`render(backend)`. MobX auto-tracks every observable read inside each callback,
so changes re-fire the right autorun with no manual dependency declarations.
React components are thin bridges: create a canvas, hand the backend to the
model via `useGpuModelLifecycle`, render JSX.

---

## The API

```ts
interface Backend {
  // plugin-defined upload/render methods
  dispose(): void
}

// In the plugin's MST model:
startGpuBackendLifecycle(backend: Backend) {
  self.installGpuDisplay<Backend>(backend, {
    upload: b => {
      // Read plugin observables, push bytes to the GPU.
      // Re-fires on any observable change.
    },
    render: b => {
      const state = self.renderState
      if (!state) return false              // renderState not ready
      return b.renderBlocks(self.renderBlocks, state)
      // return true only when real content was drawn;
      // mixin calls markCanvasDrawn() → canvasDrawn flips true →
      // MultiRegionDisplayMixin.isReady becomes true once isLoading also clears
    },
  })
}
```

---

## What the mixin owns

```
GpuBackendLifecycleSlotMixin
  .volatile
    canvasDrawn: boolean          set true only after render() returns true with real data
    currentGpuBackend: unknown    stored backend; autoruns read it each tick
    renderBump: number            bumped by renderNow() and after every upload
    gpuAutorunsInstalled: boolean guards installGpuDisplay (idempotent)
  .actions
    markCanvasDrawn()             idempotent flip to true
    resetCanvasDrawn()            flip to false (called by clearAllRpcData)
    stopGpuBackendLifecycle()     clears currentGpuBackend + resets canvasDrawn → autoruns idle
    renderNow()                   bumps renderBump → render autorun re-fires
    installGpuDisplay(b, cbs)     spawns upload + render autoruns (once)

MultiRegionDisplayMixin  (composes GpuBackendLifecycleSlotMixin)
  .views
    isReady: boolean              canvasDrawn && !isLoading — drives loading overlay
```

Loading overlays read `!model.isReady`. This keeps the overlay visible from
the moment the track opens (before GPU init and the 600ms `FetchVisibleRegions`
debounce) through the entire fetch cycle, hiding exactly once when the first
real frame is painted. `stopGpuBackendLifecycle` resets `canvasDrawn` so the
overlay reappears correctly during WebGL context-loss recovery.

All backend-specific plumbing lives in the plugin. All reactivity plumbing
lives in the mixin.

---

## Life of a frame

1. React hook (`useGpuModelLifecycle`) mounts, creates the HAL, resolves a
   backend, calls `model.startGpuBackendLifecycle(backend)`.
2. Mixin sets `currentGpuBackend = backend`, spawns two autoruns via
   `addDisposer(self, autorun(...))`.
3. Upload autorun fires: reads `currentGpuBackend`, calls `cbs.upload(b)`,
   bumps `renderBump` so render re-fires after any upload.
4. Render autorun fires: reads `currentGpuBackend` + `renderBump`, calls
   `cbs.render(b)`. If it returns `true`, flips `canvasDrawn` to `true`.
   `clearAllRpcData` resets `canvasDrawn = false` so the flag is only set
   after the canvas has real content.
5. Any observable touched by `upload` or `render` becomes a dep — when it
   changes, MobX re-fires that autorun. No manual invalidation.

### Context-loss recovery

GPU contexts can be lost. `useGpuRenderer` listens for
`webglcontextlost`/`restored` and `device.lost`, rebuilds the backend, and
calls `model.startGpuBackendLifecycle(newBackend)`. The mixin sees
`gpuAutorunsInstalled === true`, skips re-installation, just reassigns
`currentGpuBackend`. Both autoruns re-fire against the new backend. No special
code path.

### Tab visibility

`useTabVisibilityRerender` calls `model.renderNow()` on `visibilitychange`,
bumping `renderBump`. WebGPU swap-chain textures are reissued by the `render`
callback.

---

## Backend interfaces per plugin

Each plugin defines its own `Backend` interface and a factory that produces
either a GPU or Canvas 2D implementation:

```ts
export function XxxRenderer(canvas: HTMLCanvasElement) {
  return initDualBackend<XxxBackend>(
    canvas,
    XXX_PASSES,
    XXX_UNIFORM_BYTE_SIZE,
    hal => new GpuXxxRenderer(hal),
    c => new Canvas2DXxxRenderer(c),
  )
}
```

`initDualBackend` calls `createGpuHal`; if a HAL is returned, the GPU backend
is constructed, otherwise Canvas 2D.

### Three upload patterns

Per-LGV displays use one of three upload shapes; pick the one that matches
the data shape, not the one your neighbour copied:

| Pattern | Upload methods | Render | Use when | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Per-region streamed** | `uploadRegion(idx, data)` + `pruneRegions(active)` | `renderBlocks(blocks, state)` | each region's data is independent, reactive per-region updates | canvas, wiggle, multi-variant |
| **Whole-map synced** | `sync(sources)` | `renderBlocks(blocks, state)` | encoder settings drive packing, or multiple per-region streams must rebuild coherently | alignments, multi-LGV synteny |
| **Monolithic** | `uploadX(data)` | `render(state)` (no blocks) | display has no region partitioning (heatmaps spanning the whole view) | LD, multi-variant matrix |

All three patterns expose the same lifecycle (`installGpuDisplay({ upload,
render })`); the difference is how the upload callback shovels bytes.

---

## SVG export pipeline (single source of truth)

SVG export and on-screen rendering share the same draw pipeline per plugin.
Each plugin exposes two top-level pure functions:

- `drawXxxBlocks(ctx, regions, blocks, state)` — paints a pre-built regions
  map. Used by the on-screen `Canvas2DXxxRenderer.renderBlocks`.
- `drawXxxToCtx(ctx, sources, blocks, state)` — one-shot wrapper that
  builds the regions map from observable sources and calls
  `drawXxxBlocks`. Used by `renderSvg.tsx`.

Both take any 2D-context-shaped surface: real `CanvasRenderingContext2D` for
on-screen, `SvgCanvas` for vector export. `Canvas2DXxxRenderer` is bound
(canvas required at construction) — SVG export does *not* instantiate the
renderer. It calls `drawXxxToCtx` directly.

SVG export in `renderSvg.tsx` follows this recipe:

```tsx
await when(() => model.rpcDataMap.size > 0 || !!model.error || model.regionTooLarge)
if (model.error) return <SVGErrorBox …/>
const renderBlocks = buildRenderBlocks(view.visibleRegions)
const node = paintLayer(totalWidth, height, opts, ctx => {
  drawXxxToCtx(ctx, sources, renderBlocks, state)
})
```

`paintLayer` (in `@jbrowse/core/util/paintLayer`) decides between a 2× DPR
raster canvas (when `opts.rasterizeLayers`) or an `SvgCanvas`, and returns
one `ReactNode` (`<image xlinkHref=…>` or `<g dangerouslySetInnerHTML=…>`).

This kills the older "SVG-only `renderToCtx`" pattern that drifted out of
sync with the on-screen renderer (different bicolor handling, different
Y-axis offsets, different bezier curves, different palettes — each plugin
had its own flavor of drift). The canonical reference implementation is
`plugins/alignments/src/LinearAlignmentsDisplay/components/Canvas2DAlignmentsRenderer.ts`
(`drawAlignmentsToCtx` + `drawAlignmentBlocks`); other plugins follow the
same shape.

**Sashimi exception.** Sashimi arcs are deliberately rendered as vector SVG
on both paths via a shared `computeSashimiArcs(opts) → SashimiArc[]`
function: arc counts are low, vector performance is fine, and SVG `<path>`
elements give native hover/tooltip behavior the rasterized pipeline cannot
match. The on-screen `SashimiArcsOverlay` and the SVG export consume the
same arc array, so geometry and colors stay in sync. This is the *only*
draw path that intentionally avoids `paintLayer`; treat the same.

**Shared utilities** (in `@jbrowse/core/util/`):
- `createSvgRasterCanvas(width, height, opts)` — the 2× DPR canvas + `opts.createCanvas` fallback ritual.
- `paintLayer(width, height, opts, paint) → ReactNode` — raster-vs-vector dispatch.
- `Ctx2D = CanvasRenderingContext2D | SvgCanvas` — shared type alias used by every `drawXxxBlocks` signature.

---

## `rpcProps` / `gpuProps` pattern

Domain-named getters that enumerate **what affects rendering output**.

| Getter             | Consumer                                                        | Invalidation route                                                                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rpcProps`         | `rpcManager.call(..., { ...self.rpcProps, ... })` — RPC payload | Mixin `SettingsInvalidate` autorun reads `void self.rpcProps` → `clearAllRpcData` → refetch |
| `gpuProps()`       | `buildSourceRenderData(data, self.gpuProps())` — encoder input  | Upload callback reads it — MobX re-uploads without an RPC roundtrip                         |
| Derived region map | Upload callback iterates it in place of raw `rpcDataMap`        | Upload autorun reads it — MobX re-uploads without an RPC roundtrip                          |
| `renderState`      | `backend.render(state)` per frame                               | Render callback reads it — re-fires when deps shift                                         |

`gpuProps` exists wherever the main thread encodes the GPU buffer (wiggle,
multi-wiggle, multi-LGV synteny). Canvas's worker pre-builds the buffer, so
canvas has only `rpcProps`. This splits refetch from re-upload: wiggle color
change → re-encode only; `bicolorPivot` change → worker output differs →
`rpcProps` → refetch.

Derived region maps apply when upload needs whole fresh per-region payloads,
not just encoder parameters. Alignments' `laidOutPileupMap` returns shallow
clones of `rpcDataMap` entries with freshly-allocated Y arrays from
main-thread layout (+ connecting-line / Flatbush in chain mode). Raw
`rpcDataMap` is never mutated. Use derived maps when settings change the
shape/contents of per-region data; use `gpuProps` for scalars fed to an
encoder.

---

## Per-region zoom-staleness

All worker position output is **absolute genomic uint32** — no pixel
coordinates cross the worker boundary, so data stays valid under zoom. Two
exceptions for zoom-dependent *content* (not coords):

- **Wiggle**: BigWig has discrete zoom levels; the worker picks one based on
  `bpPerPx / resolution`. `isCacheValid` uses strict equality
  (`view.bpPerPx === loadedBpPerPx`) — any zoom change refetches all visible
  regions together. See `architecture-decision-records/adr-008-wiggle-strict-bpperpx-equality.md`.
- **Canvas**: the amino-acid overlay is the only `bpPerPx`-dependent worker
  decision. `isCacheValid` refetches only when the viewport crosses
  `shouldRenderPeptideBackground`'s discrete threshold.

All other plugins leave the default `() => true`.

`MultiRegionDisplayMixin`'s `FetchVisibleRegions` autorun calls the override
per region and refetches stale ones.

---

## HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)

Hides the WebGPU/WebGL2 difference. Lives in `packages/core/src/gpu/hal/`.

```
createGpuHal(canvas, passes, uniformByteSize): Promise<GpuHal | null>
  ?renderer=canvas2d     → return null
  else                   → try WebGPU → fallback WebGL2 → fallback null
```

**Key methods:** `uploadBuffer(regionKey, passId, data, count)`,
`drawPass(passId, regionKey, bufferPassId?)`, `writeUniforms(data)`,
`setScissor`, `setViewport`, `setRegionMeta` / `getRegionMeta`, `dispose()`.

**Implementations:** `WebGPUHal` (4× MSAA, device-lost recovery),
`WebGL2Hal` (`antialias: true`, VAO + UBO, context-loss recovery),
`MockHal` (tests).

**Backend override** (query param `?renderer=`): `webgpu` / `webgl` /
`canvas2d` / `canvas`; omitted → auto-detect WebGPU → WebGL2 → Canvas 2D.

---

## Shaders (Slang codegen)

Production draw shaders are authored as `.slang`, compiled to WGSL (WebGPU)
and GLSL ES 3.00 (WebGL2) by `scripts/build-shaders.ts`. See ADR-005.

**Layout:** display-specific shaders in
`plugins/<plugin>/src/<display>/shaders/<name>.slang`; per-plugin shared in
`plugins/<plugin>/src/shared/shaders/`; cross-plugin modules
(`hpmath.slang`, `colorPack.slang`) in `packages/core/src/gpu/shaders/`.
Codegen emits `<name>.generated.ts`.

**Wire-up:** `slangPass()` turns a generated module into a `PassDescriptor`,
with overrides for `topology`, `blendState`, `textures`, `picking`, and buffer
sharing.

Authoring conventions and gotchas: ADR-005.

## BP precision: why both uint32 storage AND hi/lo float math

Genomic positions exceed 3×10⁹ on T2T assemblies; float32's 24-bit mantissa
can't represent every integer past 2²⁴ ≈ 16.7 Mbp, causing ~256 bp precision
loss at 3 Gbp. GPU clip-space is unavoidably float32, so the question is
*where* precision loss happens without corrupting output.

The answer is a **two-stage representation**:

### Stage 1 — storage as uint32

Absolute genomic positions are stored as `uint32` vertex attributes. Uint32 is
exact for `[0, 2³²)` = 4.29 Gbp.

### Stage 2 — conversion to clip-space via hi/lo split

In the shader the uint32 is split into a **high** half (bits 12..31, aligned
to 4096-bp boundaries) and a **low** half (bits 0..11, values 0..4095):

```wgsl
uint lo = value & 0xFFFu;
uint hi = value - lo;
float2 split = float2(float(hi), float(lo));
```

Both halves are exact in float32 — `hi` is always an exact multiple of 4096;
`lo` is always in `[0, 4096)`.

`clippedBpStart` is split the same way on the CPU (`splitPositionWithFrac`)
and uploaded as `bpHi`/`bpLo`. The shader subtracts hi-from-hi and
lo-from-lo separately:

```wgsl
float dHi = split.x - u.bpHi;  // exact: large-large = small
float dLo = split.y - u.bpLo;  // exact: small-small = small
float clipX = (dHi + dLo) / bpLen * 2.0 - 1.0;
```

### Why we need both representations

- **uint32 only (no split)**: shader would convert uint32 → float directly,
  losing precision at 3 Gbp. Works only below ~16 Mbp.
- **float hi/lo pre-split (no uint32)**: doubles per-vertex memory (8 vs 4
  bytes) and pushes split logic onto every CPU packer.
- **uint32, split in shader (current)**: 4 bytes per vertex, precision
  preserved, CPU packers copy absolute positions unchanged. Split is 2 integer
  ops in the shader.

`hpmath.slang` provides `hpSplitUint`, `hpToClipX`, `hpScaleLinear`.
`blockClipUtils.clipBlock` emits `[bpStartHi, bpStartLo]` for the visible
window; `splitPositionWithFrac` is the CPU equivalent for UBO fields.

---

## Coordinate convention (alignments and wiggle data)

**Every** position array emitted by the alignments or wiggle worker is
**absolute genomic uint32** — reads, gaps, mismatches, interbase (ins/soft/
hardclip), softclip bases, modifications, SNP/noncov/indicator/modCov
segments, sashimi junctions, chain connecting lines, `coverageStartPos`,
`readNextPositions`, and wiggle `featurePositions`.

**Why absolute, not regionStart-relative:**

1. Region boundaries change on zoom-out. Anything keyed to `regionStart` is
   silently invalidated when the anchor shifts.
2. No signed offsets needed — genomic positions are always ≥0.
3. Reversed regions are transformed by the drawing layer (`bpToX` on Canvas2D,
   `flipX` on GPU), not the coord convention. Reversal is orthogonal.
4. All consumers (SVG export, Canvas2D, hit testing, tooltips,
   `findFeatureInRpcData`, main-thread layout) compare against absolute bp
   values. No `regionStart +` arithmetic anywhere.

**Precision across the GPU boundary:**

Every shader consumes absolute uint32 positions and converts to clip space via
hp-math.

| Shader group | Attribute | Precision technique |
|---|---|---|
| Point/edge shaders (read, gap, mismatch, insertion, modification, clip, connectingLine, arcLine, coverage, snpCoverage, noncovHistogram, indicator, modCoverage) | `uint position` | `hpClipX(hpSplitUint(absPos), u)` — hi/lo split against `bpHi`/`bpLo`. Exact at 3 Gbp. |
| arc (paired-end bezier curves) | `uint x1, x2` | `hpLinear(hpSplitUint(absPos), u)` → normalized [0,1]; bezier runs on small floats. Same precision floor. |

The alignments UBO has **no `regionStart`**, **no `domainStart`/`domainEnd`**.

**Reversed regions:** Both shader families call `flipX(sx, u)` after
computing clip-space x. `flipX(x) = lerp(x, -x, u.reversed)` maps
left-edge=`region.end`, right-edge=`region.start`.

---

## Uniforms & canvas scaling

Shader uniforms use **CSS pixels**. The HAL sets the canvas backing store to
`css × dpr`, so `N / canvas_width` in clip space equals `N` CSS pixels at any
DPR. **Do not manually scale by `devicePixelRatio`.**

---

## `displayedRegionIndex`

Zero-based index into `view.displayedRegions`. Stable unless regions are
added, removed, or reordered. **Not** an index into
`dynamicBlocks.contentBlocks` — one displayedRegion can produce multiple
render blocks that share one GPU buffer and draw with different scissor clips.

The join key across `model.rpcDataMap`, `hal.uploadBuffer(regionKey, ...)`,
and `RenderBlock.displayedRegionIndex`. Multi-LGV displays (dotplot, synteny)
key on a tuple of two displayedRegion indices.

---

## Adding a new GPU display type

- **Types** — `MyData`, `MyRenderState`, `MyBackend`.
- **Shader** — author `my.slang`; `pnpm gen:shaders` emits `my.generated.ts`.
- **Renderers + factory** — `initDualBackend<MyBackend>` from
  `packages/core/src/gpu/createDualRenderer.ts`. Use `slangPass()` to build
  the `PassDescriptor`.
- **MST model:**
  - Compose `MultiRegionDisplayMixin()` for LGV-family displays (brings in
    `GpuBackendLifecycleSlotMixin`, `FetchMixin`, fetch autorun, and
    `rpcProps`→refetch wiring); non-region displays compose
    `GpuBackendLifecycleSlotMixin()` directly.
  - Add a cached `renderState` view.
  - Define `startGpuBackendLifecycle(backend)` calling
    `self.installGpuDisplay(backend, { upload, render })`.
  - Expose `rpcProps`; add `gpuProps()` only when main thread encodes GPU
    buffers from settings.
- **React component** — `observer()`:
  ```tsx
  const { canvasRef, error, retry } = useGpuModelLifecycle(MyRenderer, model)
  return <>{error && <ErrorBar action={retry} …/>}<canvas ref={canvasRef}/></>
  ```
- **Tests** — unit (`MockHal`); browser (Puppeteer, `--backend=webgl|webgpu|canvas2d`).

---

## What NOT to do

- Don't put upload/render logic in React `useEffect`/`useLayoutEffect` —
  it belongs in the MST autorun pair spawned by `installGpuDisplay`.
- Don't destructure model methods; call on the model.
- Don't use `useMemo` for observable-dependent values; use a cached MST view.
- Don't mutate per-region values in place; emit fresh objects.
- Don't add or redefine volatiles/actions owned by the slot mixin
  (`canvasDrawn`, `renderBump`, `currentGpuBackend`, `markCanvasDrawn`,
  `resetCanvasDrawn`, `renderNow`, `stopGpuBackendLifecycle`, etc.) or the
  `isReady` view owned by `MultiRegionDisplayMixin`.
- Don't hand-maintain WGSL/GLSL/offset tables next to generated modules;
  consume the generated constants.
- Don't put fetch-result derivatives (`cellData`, `sampleInfo`, etc.) into
  `rpcProps` — `SettingsInvalidate` watches `rpcProps` and calls
  `clearAllRpcData`, which clears the very data `rpcProps` just read, creating
  an infinite fetch loop.
