## Alignments / canvas

- Read cloud: show "read bars" on the reads themselves (currently just horizontal lines).
- Group by strand, `plugins/canvas`.
- Toggle off tooltips for `LinearMultiSampleVariantDisplay`.
- Add a "hide this feature" option to `LinearMultiSampleVariantDisplay` (and similar displays).
- Quick/copy consensus, a separate quantitative splice-junction track, and sample/library (SM/LB) grouping.

## Dotplot edge-zoom jump

Zoomed all the way out, then scrolling to zoom in near the edge of the plot
makes the plot "jump" so the cursor is no longer over the same region. At every
other zoom level the area under the cursor stays put; only reproduces from the
max-zoomed-out level, and is more noticeable near the plot edge.

## Synteny follow-ups

- `multiway_synteny/ecoli_pangenome` screenshot review is marked "bad" ("why
  are the synteny curves grey here?") — the default-color comment it was
  reacting to was stale (default is red, not grey; fixed in
  `SyntenyViewInit.ts`). Regenerate the screenshot and re-review to flip the
  status.
- `multiway_synteny/grape_peach_cacao` screenshot review is marked "bad":
  wants consistent coloring for the same block across levels (the shared
  middle genome should color-match between the peach–grape and grape–cacao
  ribbons). Separate design task, still open.



## more accurate cgiab

look at wakhan, pycnv


## add extra large text svg mode for pub ready figures






## deploy example-site to branch



## occasionally mouseover on gene glyph does not show cursor pointer with mouseover shading



## add fit to height to jbrowse-img

## autofit height for lineargenomeview example-site demo

## human demo as main data in example-site demo

## mouseover sequencefeaturepanel connect to linaergenomeview3
