## Alignments / canvas

- Group by strand, `plugins/canvas`.
- Toggle off tooltips for `LinearMultiSampleVariantDisplay`.
- Add a "hide this feature" option to `LinearMultiSampleVariantDisplay` (and similar displays).
- Quick/copy consensus, a separate quantitative splice-junction track, and sample/library (SM/LB) grouping.

## Dotplot edge-zoom jump

Zoomed all the way out, then scrolling to zoom in near the edge of the plot
makes the plot "jump" so the cursor is no longer over the same region. At every
other zoom level the area under the cursor stays put; only reproduces from the
max-zoomed-out level, and is more noticeable near the plot edge.

## reversed-region browser coverage

There appears to be no browser test that flips a region, on any track type. The
reversed-block cell bug (all five alignments 1bp-cell painters painting the
neighboring base, now fixed via `makeCellLeftMapper`) survived precisely because
nothing drives a flipped region end-to-end — it's unit-tested only, and nobody
has looked at a reversed pileup on the Canvas2D fallback in the real app. A
reversed-region browser test would cover the whole class rather than that one
bug.

## Canvas2D vs GPU `canvasDrawn` contract drift

`drawAlignmentBlocks` returns `true` whenever `regions.size > 0` — decided before
it knows whether any band painted. `GpuAlignmentsRenderer.drawSection` returns
`drewCoverage || drewPileup || sec.arcBand !== undefined`. The three cases
`coverageParity.test.ts:516` pins for the GPU ("returns false when no band
paints", "returns false when the block has no synced region") would fail against
Canvas2D.

Latent, not biting: the model already gates first paint on
`laidOutPileupMap.size === 0` (`model.ts:2882`), so the loading overlay behaves.
Worth extending those same parity cases to the Canvas2D backend — but note the
trap the GPU comment records: gating the return on the pileup band once left
read-cloud (arcs-only, empty pileup) stuck on "Loading" forever. Any tightening
has to keep coverage-only and arcs-only sections counting as a paint.
