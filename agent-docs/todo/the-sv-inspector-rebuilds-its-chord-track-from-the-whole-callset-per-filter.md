# The SV inspector rebuilds its chord track from the whole callset per filter

`featuresCircularTrackConfiguration` carries every visible feature inline, so a
changed filter means `hideTrack` + `addTrackConf` on a conf holding the callset.
`showTrackGeneric` then `structuredClone`s that conf and, because it is a plain
object rather than a state-tree node, runs `trackType.configSchema.create` on it
purely to produce a nice error message before throwing the result away and
creating it for real. The callset is therefore cloned once and validated twice,
per filter change.

Two independent fixes, cheapest first:

- skip the throwaway validate for a conf built internally rather than read from
  user config. Contained, but it lives in `util/tracks.ts` and every showTrack
  path in the app goes through it, so it wants its own tests.
- stop embedding the features at all: give ChordVariantDisplay an adapter that
  reads `visibleRows` off the spreadsheet model rather than a `FromConfigAdapter`
  snapshot, so a filter change becomes a re-render instead of a track teardown.
  Bigger, and it changes what the SV inspector persists.

Measure before building either. The K562 STAR-Fusion table is 44 rows and will
show nothing; use a callset in the thousands. Note that the redundant rebuilds
are already gone — `setVisibleRows` compares before writing (`sameVisibleRowFlags`
in `SpreadsheetModel.tsx`), so what is left is genuine filter changes only, and
that is what needs timing.
