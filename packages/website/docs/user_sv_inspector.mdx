Visualizing variant tracks from the VCF format alongside the original alignment evidence track is a common workflow for validating your results. In JBrowse 2 we can open a variant track and an alignments track as shown below


<img alt="Variant with alignments" src={useBaseUrl('img/variant_with_pileup.png')} />

Figure: The variant track indicating a SNP alongside the read evidence. The variant feature details are also shown on the right-side of the screen in our "drawer widget".



## Future additions


We anticipate adding more features to the variant track in the future including


1) Ability to visualize individual samples in a multi-sample VCF as subtracks of a variant track
2) Ability to use FILTER the VCF column via the track menu
