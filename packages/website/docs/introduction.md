This guide serves to help orient and get you started with the JBrowse 2 project.
To start with, JBrowse 2 can mean different things for different people.

## JBrowse 2 web, aka jbrowse-web

The JBrowse 2 web app is a static set of html, javascript, and static resources
that you can setup on your own site. Setting up the site requires ability to
upload some files to your server. We also provide command line data loading scripts.

## JBrowse 2 desktop, aka jbrowse-desktop

We packaged the JBrowse 2 app as a desktop application that can be installed and
run as an exe on your system

This requires zero web server setup, and you can ensure that no data ever leaves
your machine (note that jbrowse-web. Files can be loaded in the GUI and your
sessions are saved to your machine for later revisiting.

## JBrowse 2 re-usable components

JBrowse 2 offers re-usable components that can help build visualizations or embed
smaller portions of the jbrowse app into your website, e.g. just a linear genome
view
