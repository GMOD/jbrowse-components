The dotplot view is a 2D comparative view that can display alignments between
different genome assemblies, or even compare a long-read or NGS short-read
versus the genome

### Opening the dotplot view

Currently the workflow for launching a dotplot is not fully fleshed out
in a way that one can add dotplot tracks in the UI but it can be manually configured

See the [dotplot configuration](config_dotplot)

### Long read vs reference

One can also launch a dotplot view that compares a long read to the reference genome

Right click on an alignments feature and select "Open dotplot view"
