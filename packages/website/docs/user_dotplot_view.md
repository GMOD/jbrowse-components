The dotplot view is a 2D comparative view that can display alignments between
different genome assemblies, or even compare a long-read or NGS short-read
versus the genome

### Opening the dotplot view

Currently the workflow for launching a dotplot is not fully fleshed out but a
pre-made configuration that compares a grape vs peach is available here
