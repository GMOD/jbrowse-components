- scaleType - options: linear, log, to display the coverage data
- adapter - this corresponds to a BamAdapter or CramAdapter or any other
  adapter type that returns alignments-like features

Example AlignmentsTrack config

    {
      "trackId": "my_alignments_track",
      "name": "My Alignments",
      "assemblyNames": ["hg19"],
      "type": "AlignmentsTrack",
      "adapter": {
        "type": "BamAdapter",
        "bamLocation": { "uri": "http://yourhost/file.bam" },
        "index": { "location": { "uri": "http://yourhost/file.bam.bai" } }
      }
    }

### PileupTrack configuration options

Note: an AlignmentsTrack automatically sets up a PileupTrack as a subtrack, so
it is not common to use PileupTrack individually, but it is allowed

- adapter - either gets it's adapter from the parent alignmentstrack or can be
  configured as any adapter that returns alignments-like features
- defaultRendering - options: pileup, svg. default: pileup

Example PileupTrack config

    {
      "trackId": "my_pileup_track",
      "name": "My Alignments",
      "assemblyNames": ["hg19"],
      "type": "PileupTrack",
      "adapter": {
        "type": "BamAdapter",
        "bamLocation": { "uri": "http://yourhost/file.bam" },
        "index": { "location": { "uri": "http://yourhost/file.bam.bai" } }
      }
    }

### SNPCoverageTrack configuration options

Note: an AlignmentsTrack automatically sets up a SNPCoverageTrack as a subtrack,
so it is not common to configure SNPCoverageTrack individually, but it is allowed

- minScore - the minimum score to plot in the coverage track. default: 0
- maxScore - the maximum score to plot in the coverage track. default: auto calculated
- scaleType - options: linear, log, to display the coverage data
- inverted - boolean option to draw coverage draw upside down. default: false
- adapter - either gets it's adapter from the parent alignmentstrack or can be
  configured as any adapter that returns alignments-like features

Example SNPCoverageTrack config

    {
      "trackId": "my_snpcov_track",
      "name": "My Alignments",
      "assemblyNames": ["hg19"],
      "type": "SNPCoverageTrack",
      "adapter": {
        "type": "BamAdapter",
        "bamLocation": { "uri": "http://yourhost/file.bam" },
        "index": { "location": { "uri": "http://yourhost/file.bam.bai" } }
      }
    }

### BamAdapter configuration options

- bamLocation - a 'file location' for the BAM
- index: a subconfigurations chema containing
  - indexType: options BAI or CSI. default BAI
  - location: the location of the index

    {

      "bamLocation": { "uri": "http://yourhost/file.bam" },
      "index": { "location": { "uri": "http://yourhost/file.bam.bai" } }
    }

### CramAdapter configuration options
