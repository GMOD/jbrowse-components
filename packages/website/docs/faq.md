## What technologies does JBrowse 2 use

- JBrowse uses React.js, using mostly functional components with React hooks
- Uses mobx-state-tree to handle state https://mobx-state-tree.js.org/
- Uses web-workers to parse data and render images
- Uses Typescript to check types
- For JBrowse 2 desktop specifically, uses Electron

## What is special about JBrowse 2?

One thing that makes JBrowse 2 special is that we can create new view
types via our plugin system. For example, we have already developed

- Circos-style whole genome overview
- Dotplot comparative view
- Linear synteny view

This makes JBrowse 2 more than just a genome browser, but really a platform
that can be built on.
