## What is a renderer?

A JBrowse 2 renderer is a specific concept that is new in JBrowse 2, and it
uses concepts called "server side rendering". With our renderers, we actually
commonly use a web-worker as the "server side", but it is helpful to think
similar to React SSR, and indeed, the renderer concept can apply to being run
on a remote server also.

Conceptually, the content that is being server side rendered are the contents
of a track, so the track calls the renderer using an RPC call, and the renderer
responds with contents like a canvas or HTML to dump into the track component.

Here is a conceptual diagram of how a track calls a renderer using the RPC

<img alt="Renderer workflo" src={useBaseUrl('img/renderer.png')} />


Note that tracks types are not required to follow this workflow, and custom
track types can implement their own logic that does not include a renderer
step, but this is a common workflow and allows us to data parsing and rendering
logic that runs in the webworker
