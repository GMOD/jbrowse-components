## What is a data adapter?

A data adapter is essentially a class that parses your data type and returns
features that jbrowse will draw

Sometimes, a data adapter can be implemented by itself, e.g. if you are
adapting a storeclass that returns genes, then you can use our standard track
types for that. If you are making a data adapter for some custom type of data
that also needs a custom type of drawing, you may need to implement a data
adapter along with a track type and/or renderer

## Outline for a JBrowse 2 data adapter

So we see basically something like this, this is stripped down for simplicity

```js
class MyAdapter extends BaseFeatureDataAdapter {
  constructor(config) {
    // config
  }
  async getRefNames() {
    // return ref names used in your data adapter
  }
  getFeatures(region) {
    // return features from your data adapter, using rxjs observable
  }
  freeResources(region) {
    // can be empty
  }
}
```

So to make a data adapter, you implement the getRefNames function (optional),
the getFeatures function (returns an rxjs observable stream of features,
discussed below) and freeResources (optional)

## Fleshed out example

To take this a little slow let's look at each function individually

This is a more complete description of the class interface that you can implement

```js
import {
  BaseFeatureDataAdapter,
} from '@gmod/jbrowse-core/data_adapters/BaseAdapter'
import SimpleFeature, { Feature } from '@gmod/jbrowse-core/util/simpleFeature'
import { readConfObject } from '@gmod/jbrowse-core/configuration'

class MyAdapter extends BaseFeatureDataAdapter {
    // @param config - a configuration object
    // @param getSubAdapter - readSubAdapter
    constructor(config, getSubAdapter) {
      // use readConfObject to read slots from the config
      const fileLocation = readConfObject(config, 'fileLocation')

      // if you need to initialize extra adapters inside your data adapter, use getSubAdapter
      const subadapter = readConfObject(config, 'sequenceAdapter')
      const sequenceAdapter = getSubAdapter(subadapter)
    }


    // @param region - { refName:string, start:number, end:number}
    // @param options - { signal: AbortSignal, bpPerPx: number }
    getFeatures(region, options) {
      // return an rxjs Observable that returns features
      return new Observable<Feature>(observer => {
        // use observer.next to return features that overlap region
        observer.next(
          new SimpleFeature({ uniqueID: 'val', refName: 'chr1', start: 0, end: 100})
        )

        // make sure to call observer.complete() when you have returned all
        // features using observer.next
        observer.complete()
      })
    }

    async getRefNames() {
        // returns the list of refseq names in the file, used for refseq renaming
        // you can hardcode this if you know it ahead of time e.g. for your own
        // remote data API or fetch this from your data file e.g. from the bam header
        return ['chr1','chr2','chr3',...]
    }

    freeResources(region) {
        // optionally remove cache resources for a region
        // can just be an empty function
    }
}
```

## Discussion

What do these functions really do

### getRefNames

Returns the refNames that are contained in the file, this is
used for "refname renaming" and is optional but highly useful in scenarios
like human chromosomes which have, for example, chr1 vs 1. Returning the
refnames used in the file allows us to automatically smooth this over

### getFeatures

A function that returns features from the file given a genomic
range query e.g. getFeatures(region, options), where region is an object like
`{ refName:string, start:number,end:number }`

### freeResources

This is uncommonly used, so most data adapters make this an empty function

Most data adapters in fact use an LRU cache to make resources go away over time
instead of manually cleaning up resources
