# Website

Website currently at http://jbrowse.org/jb2/

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern
static website generator.

Notes:

We build docusaurus and also create a PDF version with pandoc

### Notes

- The deployment goes to a sub-uri e.g. /jb2/ but our relative paths should not
  be affected by a different deployment

- We use markdown and not mdx for pandoc compatibility

- We link to images with ../img/file.png in the markdown, which works on both the website and pdf

- `docs/read_sidebar.js` parses sidebar.json and outputs markdown in order for the pandoc

- `docs/parser.js` parses markdown files and checks their header e.g. the `---\ntitle: My title\ntoplevel: true\n---`. If it does have, as noted there, `toplevel: true` if they are going to be a top level of the table of contents, and if so
  outputs a single hash `# ${title}`, otherwise it outputs a double hash `## ${title}`
