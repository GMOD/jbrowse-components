## @jbrowse/development-tools

This is a specialized rollup config that is used by our plugin-template

See https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-plugin-template/ for more info!

## Dev note

This package is not in the true monorepo/yarn workspace because the dev
dependency on tsdx forces some older versions of devtools

Therefore, if changes are made to this package, you must publish it separately
