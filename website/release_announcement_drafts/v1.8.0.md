We are pleased to release v1.8.0

This release upgrades many of our dependencies including

- material-ui v4 -> v5
- mobx-state-tree v3.14.1 -> v5
- mobx-react v6 -> v7
- mobx v5 -> v6

There may be some breaking changes due to this if you are a developer of
plugins or include @jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view in your webapp. Refer to
those package's upgrade guides for more info, and if you see any breakage, let
us know and we can help!

This release also improves bundle sizes for users of embedded components, by
adding ESM builds to NPM. This can reduce the initial load of a webpage using
e.g. @jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view by about 55% (1.4MB gzipped js->770kb
gzipped js)
