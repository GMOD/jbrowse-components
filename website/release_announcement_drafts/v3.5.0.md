## Allow user to only matches in synteny view

The synteny view is able to display long alignments, including the insertions
and deletions. However, in some long alignments, these insertions and deletions
can be distracting. This new setting will only draw the matches

Screenshot before/after toggling the setting to show only matches. This is
particularly useful for chain files because the "insertion/deletion" markers for
chain files are frequently much less relevant for chains as they, by design,
make long range connections between high scoring alignments across long
distances so the insertion/deletion calls are not as meaningful.

## Removal of the "Start screen" from jbrowse-web

This release removes the "start screen" from jbrowse-web. Instead of showing the
start screen, users are just dropped straight into the main jbrowse 2 interface.
This will hopefully "drop users into the action" faster.

## Bug fixes

Also some notably bug fixes include

- Fix for loading bigwig files created by
  [`bigtools`](https://github.com/jackh726/bigtools) (a newer Rust based bigwig
  toolkit)
- Fix for certain breakpoint split view workflows fetching too much data and
  freezing
