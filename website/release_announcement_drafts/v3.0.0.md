Seasons greetings!

We are marking a new major release of JBrowse, v3.0.0!

This doesn't contain a lot blls and whistles, it is mostly to 'signal' a
breaking change by upgrading to React v19 and generic-filehandle2 (similar to
our v2.0.0 release which was mainly related to dependency version upgrades
<https://jbrowse.org/jb2/blog/2022/07/07/v2.0.0-release/>)

If you are a plugin developer or an embedded developer and you have trouble
updating to this new latest version, please let us know!
