Hello all!

This release announces v3.0.0 of JBrowse 2. It is not at all a dramatic change
like the JBrowse 1 -> JBrowse 2 transition, it's much more incremental, and in
fact, you can go on calling it JBrowse 2...as a point of comparison, ggplot2 is
on v3.5.1 right now :)

We decided to make a major bump due to some small "breaking" changes that could
affect plugin and embedded library users in particular.

But for most users, this release should have nothing but the usual bugfixes and
improvements! And there are a lot of these!

Without further ado, here are some highlights!

## Improved rendering of phased VCF in multi-variant view

Phased variants offer a unique opportunity to see "which parent" particular
parents came from

showing a "trio VCF" with child and parents. You can visually see which blocks
the child inherited from which parents. This inspection can also be useful for
plant breeders to ensure regions that their crosses inherited particular gnomic
regions from a particular parent line

We can also render "phased sets" if the VCF is not completely phased (detects PS
tag in genotypes)

completely phased so just showing green, but each phase set would get a unique
color. The black entries are unphased variants (which could be filtered out, but
this is not done currently)

## Improved rendering of polyploid VCF in multi-variant view

Polyploid variant calls can look like `0/2/./1` indicating one match to the
reference (0), two alts (1,2), and one missing call (.).

- Yellow indicates missingness
- Grey indicates reference
- Blue indicates the ALT===1
- Red is ALT!==1

Each of these is a spectrum that increases in darkness, so darker blue indicates
more ALT===1, darker red indicates more ALT!==1, darker yellow is more uncalled,
etc.

## Adding VCF sample metadata from TSV

## Improved UI for opening synteny tracks

It has always been a little tricky to open synteny tracks

We now allow support adding synteny tracks via the default "Add track" workflow,
and make it easier to specify the query and target assembly names

form, also showing new UI for choosing query and target assmblies

## New "turbo zoom" buttons

In working with users, we noticed people having to click the zoom buttons or
fiddle with the slider a lot. To aid this, we added a small dropdown for quickly
doing 10x, 50x, and 100x zooms

## For developers: some "breaking" changes

1. We changed the "filehandle" type used in data adapters. We now use
   generic-filehandle2 which is simpler and does not require a node.js polyfill
   on the web
2. Upgrading React 18 -> React 19 in our main webapp. This drops support for
   React 17, and may have some other implications

If you are a plugin or embedded user, and experience problems with upgrading,
let us know!
