We are happy to release v2.1.6

This has several important fixes and improvements

- Tracks no longer hang in "Loading..." state under Safari and Webkit based
  browsers, a bug with starting the webworker was fixed
- There is now an option to use the WebWorkerRpc on the
  @jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view. This is a great improvement because the
  WebWorkerRpc dramatically reduces the "stalling" of the main thread when
  large datasets like BAM/CRAM are being loaded. See
  https://jbrowse.org/storybook/lgv/main/?path=/story/using-webworker-rpc--page
  for more info!
- All feature types, not just gene features, can obtain the underlying feature
  sequence with upstream/downstream options
- The ability to refer to plugins in a path relative to your data directory
  has been fixed, so you can easily refer to plugins in your config file with
  e.g. `"plugins":[{"name":"MyPlugin","umdLoc":{"uri":"myplugin.js"}}]`
  (`umdLoc` resolves the uri relative to the config.json file that it is in
  use). There is also `umdUrl` which can be used in place of `umdLoc` which can
  be used like this `"plugins":[{"name":"MyPlugin","umdUrl":"myplugin.js"}]`
  and this will resolve relative to the jbrowse root directory e.g. where the
  index.html is. We recommend using UMD for now, as ESM modules do not have
  full browser support e.g. in firefox yet, but this will likely be changing
  soon and we will update tutorials when this occurs!
