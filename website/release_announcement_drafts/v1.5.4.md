This release fixes an important bug for users of
@jbrowse/react-linaer-genome-view where some features would not be able to be
clicked in v1.5.3 and v1.5.2.

It also adds some better layout in the feature details panel, improved
typescript interfaces, and allows users to open multiple genome assemblies from
the start screen in JBrowse Desktop
