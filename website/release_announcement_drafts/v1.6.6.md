We are pleased to release v1.6.6!

This contains several improvements to synteny, including the ability to load
.chain files and .delta files from mummer, and improved ability to use MCScan
.anchors (gene pairs) and .anchors.simple (larger synteny blocks).

The configuration schema for MCScan anchors files changed also, to now load the
.bed file at startup. This is more reliable and allows us to load
.anchors.simple (which shows large synteny blocks). See the config guide for
details

There have also been some changes to how internet accounts work. If you use one
of the built-in accounts like Google Drive or Dropbox, there's no need to change
anything. If you've implemented your own internet account, though, see
[#2725](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/pull/2725) for more details.
