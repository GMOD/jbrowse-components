We are pleased to present v1.7.9!

This release features several bugfixes and improvements submitted by community
members, including a CLI fix when specifying --indexFile with CSI files, and a
new feature to get FASTA metadata from an external file.

Additionally, we have switched to canvas2svg for SVG exports, which can now
handle more sophisticated operations like bezierCurves (used for sashimi-style
arc in RNA-seq data), and circles (used by jbrowse-plugin-gwas)

Before (note bad intron and lack of arcs rendered on bottom track)
