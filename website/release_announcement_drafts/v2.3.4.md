Hello all,

This release incorporates a "faceted track selector" similar to JBrowse 1. This
track selector is available by default as an alternative to the hierarchical
selector, to give users the "best of both worlds"

The faceted selector is a dialog box that is opened from a button "Open faceted
selector" at the top of the hierarhical selector.

There are a couple other important bugfixes relating to horizontal flipping in
the synteny view, and selecting features in the synteny view.

We really enjoyed meeting everyone at PAG 2023 and hearing all the feedback
everyone had! We hope to continue rolling out more improvements over the coming
year :)
