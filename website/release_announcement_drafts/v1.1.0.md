We're pleased to announce a new release of JBrowse Web!

## Changed callbacks language from JavaScript to Jexl

To allow users to safely and seamlessly share advanced configurations in sessions, we now use [Jexl](https://github.com/TomFrost/Jexl/blob/master/README.md) to express configuration callbacks. Note that this is a breaking change, `function()`-style callbacks will no longer work.

For details, see the [callbacks section of our configuration guide](../docs/config_guide#configuration-callbacks).

## Fetch intron and upstream/downstream sequences

We also have several other improvements including the ability to get intron and
upstream/downstream sequence in the feature details

## Interactive documentation using Storybook

Another new update is the first release of our interactive Storybook docs for the embeddable React Linear Genome View.
The docs contain live examples of how the LGV component can be used, along with source-code examples.
The site can be found [here](https://jbrowse.org/storybook/lgv/v1.1.0).

## Enhanced navigation to drawer widget stack

We have added a dropdown to enhance navigation between stack of active widgets. The update also adds a minimize button to allow quick access to full screen JBrowse web.

See below for demos of the new navigation UI.
