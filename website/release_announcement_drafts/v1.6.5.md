We are pleased to announce v1.6.5!

This features some various bugfixes to the @jbrowse/cli tool, including better
support for large config files with the admin-server, and renaming --out to
--root for the admin-server.

It also includes two important fixes related to stats estimation in 1.6.4, one
where tracks would display an error on sparse tracks and another where tracks
would fail to perform stats estimation on BAM files due to a type confusion.
