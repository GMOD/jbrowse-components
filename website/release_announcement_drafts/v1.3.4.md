This release adds a new UMD build of our
[`@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view)
React component. This build will allow users to use our React Linear Genome View
in a website that doesn't otherwise use React. See a tutorial for how to get
started using this build:

- https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/tutorials/embed_linear_genome_view/01_introduction

A preliminary beta version of this build was used in a tutorial at BOSC2020,
and that tutorial was also on our website. If you've used that version, the
interface has changed somewhat, so come check out the new tutorial for the
official released version!
