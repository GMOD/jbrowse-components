This release includes a quality-of-life improvement for users plotting synteny
with CIGAR strings. Before this version, the x-axis in the dotplot was assumed
to be target sequence (and similarly, the top row in the linear synteny view
was assumed to be the target sequence). But now, target can be either x- or
y-axis in dotplot, and top or bottom in linear synteny views, removing the need
for the user to care as much about query-vs-target ordering.

This release also includes several fixes for the the behavior of text searching
in the linear genome view, a new button to open a .jbrowse file directly from
the start screen on jbrowse-desktop, and an important bugfix to plotting
inverted alignments on dotplots that affected versions v2.1.0-v2.1.2.

Enjoy!
