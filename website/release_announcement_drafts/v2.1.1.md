Hello all, we are pleased to announce v2.1.1!

This release includes a number of small bugfixes to the multi-wiggle track
type, and a new feature for performing small sequence searches/motifs in the
visible region.

on the linear genome view

Also, we just recently published the pre-print for our JBrowse 2 paper on
bioRxiv! https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.28.501447v1

This is a tour de force describing the basic ideas behind JBrowse 2 as an app.
We are really pleased with how users and developers have helped to contribute
to JBrowse 2 thus far, and look forward to many more years!
