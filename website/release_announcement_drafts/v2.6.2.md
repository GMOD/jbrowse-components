This is a small bugfix release. We now use `inlineSourceMap` instead of external
.map files to avoid some typescript warnings for consumers of our NPM packages.
This means our "src" is no longer published to NPM.

We also fixed the "Stranded sequencing" coloring option on alignments tracks,
which is especially useful for stranded paired-end RNA-seq. We renamed to option
"Color by->First of pair strand" also, which corresponds to the terminology of
IGV.
