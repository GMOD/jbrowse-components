This fixes a couple of bugs:

- fixed inkscape/illustrator compatibility with SVG exports
- fixed an issue where bookmarks would show up or crash due to loading on the
  incorrect assembly, and more
- improved remembering of the state of the collapsed categories in the track
  selector using localStorage
