## Feature detail formatter

Here is an example which adds a link to the "Name" panel in the feature
details. It uses the jexl callback that returns an object with keys for each
field to modify (e.g. the key name is used here). See

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureTrack",
  "trackId": "ncbi_gff_hg19_2",
  "name": "NCBI RefSeq",
  "formatDetails": {
    "feature": "jexl:{name:'<a href=https://google.com/?q='+feature.name+'>'+feature.name+'</a>'}"
  },
  "assemblyNames": ["hg19"],
  "adapter": {
    "type": "Gff3TabixAdapter",
    "gffGzLocation": {
      "uri": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/jbrowse.org/genomes/hg19/ncbi_refseq/GRCh37_latest_genomic.sort.gff.gz"
    },
    "index": {
      "location": {
        "uri": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/jbrowse.org/genomes/hg19/ncbi_refseq/GRCh37_latest_genomic.sort.gff.gz.tbi"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
