We are excited to announce the latest JBrowse release! This has many great
features including

1. Floating feature labels, so if you are zoomed into the middle of a gene, the
   feature label hangs out alongside it on the left side of the screen

2. Upgraded build system to webpack 5, resulting in smaller build sizes and
   all-around more modern tooling

3. Optimizations to breakpoint split view and synteny views!

4. Assembly selector remembers your last selection, so you can more easily
   return to your genome of interest
