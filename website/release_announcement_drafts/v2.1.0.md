We are pleased to present 2.1.0! This release adds some significant new
features including:

- Multi-wiggle tracks - This allows, for example, multiple bigwig files to be
  displayed in a single track with synchronized scalebar settings. See
  [multi-wiggle docs](/jb2/docs/user_guide/#multi-quantitative-tracks) for more
  info.
- Undo and redo functionality, let's you undo an operation in the UI e.g.
  closing a view, closing a track can be recovered
- An alert when the dotplot view renders features that go beyond the bounds of
  the selected region. This is often an indication that the wrong assembly is
  being used or the query and target are backwards
