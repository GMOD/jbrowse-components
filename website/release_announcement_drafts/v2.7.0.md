This release contains a number of new features and improvements

- adds the concept of a 'focused view' and keyboard shortcuts for zoom in/out
  (ctrl or cmd+up/down) and side to side scroll (ctrl or cmd +left/right)

- make bookmark persistent in localstorage so that they are usable across
  different sessions

- upgrades jbrowse-web and jbrowse-desktop to use React 18 and latest versions
  of mobx+mobx-react+mobx-state-tree, and enable React.StrictMode

Note: embedded users can also opt-into React 18 for their apps, see lgv
storybook for details
