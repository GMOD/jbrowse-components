Hello all! This release adds some great new features!

- New "arc" and "read cloud" alignments track modes which render long range
  connections between read pairs/split reads. These views have a big impact on
  being able to visualize structural variants.

- We now automatically optimize the "prefix size" for our trix indexes created
  by `jbrowse text-index` which should help solve issues with slow text
  searching.

- We now refer to many pluggable elements by a "display name" instead of the
  coded class name so we have instead of "LinearGCContentDisplay" -> "GC content
  display".

### New alignments track displays

We created a new display mode that changes the "pileup" of reads into "arcs"
which connects both paired-end reads and split-long read alignments.

## Easily toggleable "compact" view of alignments

We now have an easily toggleable compact setting on alignments tracks
(previously had to manually change feature height)

## Optimized prefix size for text search indexing

Previously, if indexing long gene IDs with `jbrowse text-index` it would often
be slow because the "trix" format is generally optimized for short gene symbols.
We added the --prefixSize parameter in previous jbrowse versions to allow
optimizing for specific gene lengths, but this was sort of a magic number. Now,
`jbrowse text-index` will automatically calculate the --prefixSize if none is
provided, which tries to get an even ~64kb bin size. Let us know how it goes for
your data!

Re-install the CLI tools with e.g. `npm install -g @jbrowse/cli` to get the
latest version with this feature.

## Moved "Track Hub Registry" plugin to plugin store

We removed the "Track Hub Registry" plugin, which was previously a "core
plugin", to the plugin store. This will allow us to update the plugin over time
and respond better to issues when they change their remote API.
