We are happy to present v2.1.5! This release adds the ability for the embedded
linear genome view component to have session tracks, and we added a new UI for
alerts/errors on tracks. See the changelog for details.

Other issues with the circular genome view, authentication on jbrowse-desktop,
and the trackhub registry were also fixed. Enjoy!
