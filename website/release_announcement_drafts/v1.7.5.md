We are pleased to present the release of v1.7.5

This release includes two major improvements

- Ability to index tracks for searching by gene names in JBrowse Desktop
- Removed serialization of BAM/CRAM features for pileup tracks which brings
  large performance benefits for jbrowse-web and jbrowse-desktop

It also fixes a bug with using trix indexes created by `jbrowse text-index` in
v1.7.0-v1.7.4 (with the adjustable prefix size)
