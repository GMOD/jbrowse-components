Hello all,

This release adds that should improve performance. Internally, we removed the
concept of the linear synteny `renderer`. This refactoring also enabled
self-vs-self alignments to be rendered by the linear synteny view which
previously was not supported.

We also fixed the desktop app not being able to auto-update in v2.2.2-v2.3.2

Please manually download this release!
