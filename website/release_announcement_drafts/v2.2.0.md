This release includes several important improvements including

- Lazily loading assembly refNames: previously when you had multiple assemblies
  in your config, it would load all their refNames at browser startup. Now, it
  only fetches refNames when you request to use an assembly.
- Simplified "synteny track selector" on the dotplot and synteny import forms
- Improved documentation! The entire jbrowse 2 documentation has been
  overhauled, and the monolithic user guide, config guide, and developer guide
  pages have been split into smaller pages. We also now auto-generate
  documentation on our config and state tree models, and have a search bar
- Improved speed on alignments tracks: a small optimization was made for
  alignments tracks that can improve performance on alignments tracks by 30% or
  so especially on short reads

release) vs main (which was v2.1.7)

Note that the changes to allow lazy loading assemblies may have somewhat
changed the "contract", so if your code is using the assemblyManager directly
in any places, please be aware of this change. Proper usage of the
assemblyManager API uses either

1. use assemblyManager.get(assemblyName) which can return undefined initially,
   but then this initiates the lazy load and can be caught by reactivity of
   wrapping your components in observers
2. use assemblyManager.waitForAssembly(assemblyName) function, which is
   asynchronous but returns a promise. this avoids the initial return undefined
   behavior
3. avoid directly accessing e.g. assemblyManager.assemblies
