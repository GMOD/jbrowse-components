This release adds the ability to highlight regions on the linear genome view.

Users can specify a highlight via the URL when they use jbrowse-web, in a format
like &loc=chr1:1-1000&assembly=hg19&highlight=chr1:1-100 (it must be used with
the &loc and &assembly)

This release also fixes the ability to load BAM and CRAM files where the refName
contains a colon
