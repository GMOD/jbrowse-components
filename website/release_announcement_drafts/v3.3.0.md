This release adds a significant update to the multi-variant renderer that allows
it to be used for visualizing structural variants

Previously, all variants >10bp were filtered out, with the idea that overlapping
variants are too difficult to interpret

This PR now just displays overlapping variants, but does not specifically draw
the reference allele, which allows it to highlight the alternate structural
variant alleles, and can display complex SV VCFs in the "Multi-variant
(regular)" display type.

Note: The "Multi-variant (matrix)" display type is not suited for this SV VCF
rendering as it takes every variant and just gives it a single column in the
matrix.
