This release adds a significant update to the multi-variant renderer that allows
it to be used for visualizing structural variants Previously, all variants >10bp
were filtered out, with the idea that overlapping variants are too difficult to
interpret

This PR now allows drawing large structural variants in the multi-sample variant
display type. One compromise is that it specifically does not draw the reference
allele using grey, but instead paints the entire background as grey, and only
highlights non-reference variation. This is capable of displaying complex
overlapping structural multi-sample VCF
