We're excited to announce the v1.2.0 release of JBrowse Web!

## New plugin store added to website

One of the core aspects of JBrowse 2 is that it is an extensible
platform for biological visualization that can be extended with
plugins. We are excited to introduce the first version of our
plugin store, where we list the current external plugins that
are available. Check it out [here](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/plugin_store).
In the coming weeks, we will also be bringing this plugin store directly
into the application, allowing plugin installation with the click of a button.
Stay tuned!

## SVG export

We're excited to introduce a new feature to JBrowse Web: built-in
SVG export of track visualizations! This feature currently supports
the linear genome view, and will be extended to more views in future
releases.

With the addition of this feature, it is now even easier to create
publication-ready screenshots of JBrowse views.

## Virtualized track lists

An important consideration for genomics software is scaling to very large
datasets. We have implemented a virtualization of our hierarchical track
selector, enabling it to support arbitrarily large track lists.

## Lazy loading

We have expanded our use of [lazy loading](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy), which optimizes app performance and
improves load times.
