This release marks a number of improvements including

- Ability to display multi-sample VCF in a 'matrix' or 'stacked' style view
- Major improvements to the spreadsheet and SV inspector views, including:
  - Let's you open tracks from in the spreadsheet and SV inspector
  - Let's you re-navigate the breakpoint split view instead of launching a new
    one each time
  - Uses @mui/x-data-grid for display of the spreadsheet
  - Makes separate columns for VCF INFO fields
  - Ability to open much larger files
- Auto-saves user sessions to a local IndexedDB, so you won't lose your sessions
  anymore if your web browser closes (!!)
  - Users can easily create "favorite" sessions to revisit for later, and admins
    can create pre-configured sessions for their instancse for users
- Improved 'aborting' behavior, still an ongoing process
