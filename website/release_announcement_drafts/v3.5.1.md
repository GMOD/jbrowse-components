Hi all, This has a number of small bugfixes and features, but a couple
highlights

## Better dropdown menus

In previous releases, the dropdown submenus would close the instant your mouse
left their boundaries, but now, they stay open until you select a menu item or
click away. This can be very useful when accessing nested submenus

## Ability to customize root configuration

We added the ability for plugins to add new entries to the root configuration.
This now makes it possible to add easy-to-access configuration for your plugin.
Example:

```typescript
export default class MsaViewPlugin extends Plugin {
  name = 'MyPlugin'

  install(pluginManager: PluginManager) {}

  configure(pluginManager: PluginManager) {}

  rootConfigurationSchema(pluginManager: PluginManager) {
    return {
      mything: ConfigurationSchema('MyConfig', {
        greetings: {
          type: 'string',
          defaultValue: 'hello world',
        },
      }),
    }
  }
}
```

A user could then customize their greeting in a new way like

```json
{
  "assemblies": [...],
  "tracks": [...],
  "plugins": [...],
  "mything": {
    "greeting": "hello jbrowsers"
  }
}
```

This can then be used in your code by
`readConfObject(session.jbrowse, ['mything','greetings'])`

Here is an example used by the MSA view plugin
https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-plugin-msaview/blob/7027f01abe2b4253fd2a250021d2b13a1b4f2fce/src/index.ts#L37-L59

We anticipate that this will enable new and easier plugin customizations
