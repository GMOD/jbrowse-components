Hi all, This has a number of small bugfixes and features, but a couple
highlights

## Better dropdown menus

In previous releases, the dropdown submenus would close the instant your mouse
left their boundaries. This was often unintentional. They now stay open until
you select a menu item or click away

## Ability to customize root configuration

We added the ability for plugins to add new entries to the root configuration.
This might be somewhat uncommong, but it can make it possible to add
easy-to-access configuration for your plugin. Normally, the root configuration
has your tracks, assemblies, etc. But you can add extra entries now with
"rootConfigurationSchema" on your plugin

```typescript
export default class MsaViewPlugin extends Plugin {
  name = 'MyPlugin'

  install(pluginManager: PluginManager) {}

  configure(pluginManager: PluginManager) {}

  rootConfigurationSchema(pluginManager: PluginManager) {
    return {
      mything: ConfigurationSchema('MyConfig', {
        greetings: {
          type: 'string',
          defaultValue: 'hello world',
        },
      }),
    }
  }
}
```

A user could then customize their greeting in a new way like

```json
{
  "assemblies": [...],
  "tracks": [...],
  "plugins": [...],
  "mything": {
    "greeting": "hello jbrowsers"
  }
}
```

This can then be used in your code by
`readConfObject(session.jbrowse, ['mything','greetings'])`

Here is an example used by the MSA view plugin
https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-plugin-msaview/blob/7027f01abe2b4253fd2a250021d2b13a1b4f2fce/src/index.ts#L37-L59

We anticipate that this will enable new and easier plugin customizations
