We're excited to present some great new features and performance improvements
in v1.5.2!

## New plugin module formats

We now allow creating ESM and CJS bundles for plugins. The CJS bundle in
particular may be ideal for plugin developers since it can access native node
modules on JBrowse Desktop

## Performance improvements

The alignments track now has 25% faster speed on most datasets and particularly
on deep short read sequencing, it can be up to 10x faster.
