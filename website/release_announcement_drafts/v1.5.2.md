We're excited to present some great new features and performance improvements
in v1.5.2!

## New arc display type

A new display type has been added for drawing arcs. The color, thickness,
height, label, and caption of the arcs can be customized.

## New plugin build system

We've re-worked the system used by developers to build external plugins for more
stability and flexibility. The current plugin build system will continue to
work, but if you want to check out how the new template works, check out the
[JBrowse Plugin Template](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-plugin-template).

## Storybook docs added for Circular Genome View React component

Find them linked under `@jbrowse/react-circular-genome-view` [here](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/download/#embedded-components).

## Performance improvements

The alignments track now has 25% faster speed on most datasets and particularly
on deep short read sequencing, it can be up to 10x faster.
