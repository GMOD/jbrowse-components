This release adds some significant new features

- Alignments track 'Group by' functionality: this features allows you to split
  an alignments track by a specific tag such as RG or HP into multiple new
  session tracks
- A new adapter type display sequences from a FASTA file such as `NC_000001.10`
  in the user interface as `chr1`. This specifically targets the NCBI
  "sequence_report.tsv" to do this renaming, and is called
  `NcbiSequenceReportAliasAdapter`

functionality to group by the HP (haplotype) tag. Note that technically, each
group is launched as a separate new "session track"
