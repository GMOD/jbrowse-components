This release adds a new synteny file format PIF - pairwise indexed PAF. This new
format enables large whole genome alignments to be loaded with ease.

We demonstrate this, we created a demo using the human vs mouse genome
alignment, where the full PAF file representing the alignment is over 60MB of
gzipped data (unzips to over 200MB in memory), but with PIF, only ~3MB of PIF
data needs to be downloaded!

To prepare a PIF file, you can use the @jbrowse/cli tool:

```bash
jbrowse make-pif file.paf
```

This generates file.pif.gz and file.pif.gz.tbi in the same folder. Conceptually,
it is just a tabix file that allows querying the PAF from either the
query->target or the target->query. We have not yet improved the amount of data
needed to view whole-genome overviews of the whole genome alignment e.g. whole
genome dotplot but we anticipate creating optional sections for the PIF to
improve this as well by downsampling the CIGAR string or similar.

We also added the ability to visually highlight regions from the Bookmark
widget.
