We are pleased to present the release of v1.5.0! We have some major new
features to announce with this version!

## JBrowse Desktop

JBrowse Desktop is our fully featured desktop application available for Mac,
Windows, and Linux.

Everything you can do with JBrowse Web, you can do with JBrowse Desktop! In
fact, because it runs as a desktop app, JBrowse Desktop can do things that the
web can't like saving sessions to a file on your computer to revisit later.

JBrowse Desktop features a new landing page designed to help you manage your
work. Here's a few things you can do with it:

- quick-launch a new session from the landing page using a list of assemblies
- hop back into a previous session using either the grid-view or the list-view
  interfaces
- quickly rename or delete sessions from the landing page

With JBrowse Desktop, your genome browser and your web browser can finally live
in harmony on your taskbar! :heart:

## Access authenticated resources

This release also contains the ability to access authenticated resources. For
JBrowse Desktop, we baked in the ability to open files from Google Drive and
Dropbox share links.
