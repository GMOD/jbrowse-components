We are pleased to present the release of v1.5.0! We have some major new
features to announce with this version!

## JBrowse Desktop

We are thrilled to finally release our cross-platform desktop app, JBrowse
Desktop. This contains all the features available on JBrowse Web, but can be
installed locally on your computer.

On the landing page of JBrowse desktop can re-visit saved sessions, launch new
sessions easily (e.g. hg19 and hg38 are built in genome assemblies you can
quickly launch, you can also make your own entries for the quickstart list),
and much more.

## Access authenticated resources

This release also contains the ability to access authenticated resources. For
JBrowse Desktop, we baked in the ability to open files from Google Drive and
Dropbox share links.
