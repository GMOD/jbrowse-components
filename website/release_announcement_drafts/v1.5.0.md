We are pleased to present the release of v1.5.0! We have some major new
features to announce with this version!

## JBrowse Desktop

JBrowse Desktop is our fully featured desktop application available for Mac,
Windows, and Linux.

Everything you can do with JBrowse Web, you can do with JBrowse Desktop! In
fact, because it runs as a desktop app, JBrowse Desktop can do things that the
web can't like saving sessions to a file on your computer to revisit later.

JBrowse Desktop features a new landing page designed to help you manage your
work. Here's a few things you can do with it:

- re-visit saved sessions using the recent session panel
- launch new sessions easily from the quick start panel (e.g. hg19 and hg38 are built-in)
- create a new entries in the quick start panel (e.g. quick launch your favorite organism)
- quickly rename or delete sessions from the landing page

With JBrowse Desktop, your genome browser and your web browser can finally live
in harmony on your taskbar! :heart:

## Access authenticated resources

This release also contains the ability to access authenticated resources. For
JBrowse Desktop, the ability to open files from Google Drive and Dropbox share
links is built in. For JBrowse Web, administrators can add some extra
configuration to set these up.
