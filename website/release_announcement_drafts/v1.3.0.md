We're excited to announce the v1.3.0 release of JBrowse Web! Some highlights of
this release include:

## In-app plugin store

Building on the plugin store on our website in the last release, we're now
excited to announce that plugins can be installed from within JBrowse Web!
Plugins from our plugin store can now be installed with the click of a button.

## Open local files

JBrowse Web now has the ability for tracks to use files on your local hard
drive. This is a great option if you want to visualize files you have locally
without uploading them to a server. These files will need to be re-opened each
time the app is opened or refreshed, but more robust handling of local files
will be available when we release JBrowse Desktop.

## Color by MM and MP/ML tags in BAM/CRAM

The MM and MP/ML tags can be used to color alignments tracks by either base
modifications or by methylation. The modifications mode is exciting because it
can show arbitrary DNA/RNA modifications, and the methylation mode uses
specific CpG context to show both modified and unmodified CpGs.
