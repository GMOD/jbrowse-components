Hello all! We are excited to announce the new features in this release. Here are
some highlights

## More theme options and dark mode

The jbrowse web and jbrowse desktop app now has multiple themes that a user can
pick between in the jbrowse-web and jbrowse-desktop apps.

Extra themes can be defined via plugins or via your config file.

See [the theme docs](/docs/config_guides/theme) for more info and let us know if
you have any requests

## SVG export of more view types

Dotplot, circular, and linear synteny views have added an SVG export option. The
breakpoint split view is one of the few view types without the SVG export now.
The SVG exports can incorporate the current theme, or use a default.
