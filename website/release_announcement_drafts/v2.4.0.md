Hello all!

## More theme options

The jbrowse web and jbrowse desktop app now has multiple themes that a user can
pick between in the jbrowse-web and jbrowse-desktop apps. Extra themes can be
defined via plugins or via your config file. It takes some extra work to make
sure styling works with all themes but hopefully this gives users more choices
for styling the app

## SVG export of more view types

Dotplot, circular, and linear synteny views have added an SVG export option. The
breakpoint split view is one of the few view types without the SVG export now.
The SVG exports can incorporate the current theme, or use a default.
