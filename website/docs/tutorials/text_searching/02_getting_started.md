### Creating a JBrowse2 instance

The first thing we will want to do, is ensure that we have configured the tracks and assemblies that you intent to index.

### Adding Assemblies

### Adding Tracks

There are a couple ways in which you can add tracks to your JBrowse instance:

- From the menu bar in the app File -> Open Track
- Using the "+" button inside the track selector menu -> "Add Track"
- if you are an administrator, you can add tracks with the command line or with the admin server

Note: We currently only support VCF and GFF3 file types, but we hope to add more in the near future.

For this tutorial, we will add tracks via the command line.

The config.json should look something like this now.
