In this tutorial, we set up a development environment for JBrowse 2 and added a custom pluggable element to a plugin.

We also published the plugin to NPM and requested that it be added to the JBrowse plugin store so others can access our plugin.

To learn more about the various pluggable elements available in JBrowse (and thus more that you can do with plugins!) checkout our [developer guide documentation](../../../developer_guide/).

If you have further questions about plugin development, or development with JBrowse in general, stop by the JBrowse team [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/GMOD/jbrowse2), or start a discssion on the [jbrowse-components discussions forum](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/discussions).
