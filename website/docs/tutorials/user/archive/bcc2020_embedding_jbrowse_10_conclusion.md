## That's it!

Congratulations, you've embedded JBrowse 2 in a web page! Now you can start to
experiment and explore. Some things to try might be:

- Add two views to the same web page
- Find your own files to add as tracks
- Explore the [configuration guide](config_guide) and learn how to do things
  like customize the colors of features in your tracks

Let us know how things go. We'd love to hear your feedback or help you in any
way we can. Our contact information can be found [here](.#contact-information).

Happy hacking!
