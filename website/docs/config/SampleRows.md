Auto-generated from the config schema in the source — see the [config guide](/docs/config_guide) for concepts. Built into JBrowse core. [View source](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/blob/main/packages/display-kit/src/sampleRowsConfigSchema.ts).

The `rows` of a display whose rows are the file's samples, one each, with
nothing else a row could be: the variant display and the
multiple alignment display. `sample` is the one field, so the object is
the arrangement a reader gives the rows, and writing it changes only the
members stated. Nothing needs `rows: "sample"`, which writes nothing.

## Example usage

```js
{ type: 'LinearVariantDisplay', rows: { sort: ['HG002', 'HG003'] } }
```

```js
{
  type: 'LinearMafDisplay',
  rows: { sort: ['mm10'], labels: { mm10: 'Mouse' }, kept: ['mm10', 'hg38'] },
}
```

## Config slots

Slot types (`fileLocation`, `frozen`, ...) are explained in the [config slot types reference](/docs/config_guides/slot_types). Slots a base configuration contributes are listed here too, so this table is the whole surface.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Slot | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <span id="slot-field">**field**</span><br>[`stringEnum`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#stringenum) (sample) = <code>'sample'</code> | `sample`, the one field a row of these displays can be: a sample or a haplotype of one on the variant display, a genome on the alignment. |
| <span class="slot-group">Inherited from [Rows](../rows)</span> | <span class="slot-group-count">3 slots</span> |
| <span id="slot-axis">**axis**</span><br>[RowAxisWithGrid](../rowaxiswithgrid) | The guide down the left of the rows, a [RowAxisWithGrid](../rowaxiswithgrid): whether the tree and the row names draw, the sidebar's width, and a line between rows. What it draws is `rows.tree` and `rows.labels`. |
| <span id="slot-colors">**colors**</span><br>[`stringMap`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#stringmap) = <code>{}</code> | A color pinned on a row, by name, over whatever `rows.color` maps it to, as `labels` pins its text: ggplot2's `scale_*_manual(values = c(name = ...))`. The arrangement dialog's row swatches write it. A row with none takes `rows.color`, else the file's own color (MAF's `samples[].color`, a listed source's color), else the palette where the rows share one panel. |
| <span id="slot-color">**color**</span><br>[RowColor](../rowcolor) | The rows colored by an attribute: a [RowColor](../rowcolor) channel from a row field through a scale, `name` (each row) by default. Per-row colors are `rows.colors`, which win over it. |
| <span class="slot-group">Inherited from [RowArrangement](../rowarrangement)</span> | <span class="slot-group-count">4 slots</span> |
| <span id="slot-sort">**sort**</span><br>[`stringArray`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#stringarray) = <code>[]</code> | The row order, as Vega-Lite's `sort` lists it: the rows listed lead, in this order, and none is dropped. The rest keep the order their source lists them in (a VCF's samples, a multi-BigWig's subtracks), or sort, digits by magnitude, where the rows are values found on features. A clustering run, the arrangement dialog and "Sort rows here" all write it, and a run rotates its dendrogram towards it rather than discarding it. |
| <span id="slot-labels">**labels**</span><br>[`stringMap`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#stringmap) = <code>{}</code> | A label drawn beside a row in place of its name, by name. Whether any label draws is `rows.axis.labels`. |
| <span id="slot-tree">**tree**</span><br>[RowTree](../rowtree) | The dendrogram beside the rows, a [RowTree](../rowtree): newick, or `{ newick, provenance }` where a clustering run wrote it beside the order it produced. A reorder that moves a row drops it. Whether it draws is `rows.axis.tree`. |
| <span id="slot-kept">**kept**</span><br>[`stringArray`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#stringarray) = <code>[]</code> | The rows shown, by name: a clade picked off the tree, or the rows one key row stands for. It narrows the rows to those it names, after `filter` where the display declares one; empty shows every row, and a list naming no current row shows none, with a notice. Keyed: a write changing `field` clears it. |
