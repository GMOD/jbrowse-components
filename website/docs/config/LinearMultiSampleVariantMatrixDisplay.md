Auto-generated config schema for the current JBrowse release — see the [config guide](/docs/config_guide) for concepts. Provided by the `variants` plugin. [View source](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/blob/main/plugins/variants/src/LinearMultiSampleVariantMatrixDisplay/configSchema.ts).

## Example usage

Minimal `VariantTrack` config selecting the matrix display. The `displays`
array form is required here (rather than the object shorthand) because
this is a non-default display type — see
[configuring displays](/docs/config_guides/tracks#configuring-displays):

```js
{
  type: 'VariantTrack',
  trackId: 'cohort',
  name: 'Cohort variants',
  assemblyNames: ['hg38'],
  adapter: {
    type: 'VcfTabixAdapter',
    uri: 'https://example.com/cohort.vcf.gz',
  },
  displays: [
    {
      type: 'LinearMultiSampleVariantMatrixDisplay',
    },
  ],
}
```

Preloading sample metadata: point the adapter's `samplesTsvLocation` at a TSV
whose first column is the sample name and whose other columns are per-sample
attributes (e.g. `population`), then `rowColor` one of those attributes to
color the matrix rows on load (same metadata mechanism as the regular
`LinearMultiSampleVariantDisplay`):

```js
{
  type: 'VariantTrack',
  trackId: 'cohort',
  name: 'Cohort variants',
  assemblyNames: ['hg38'],
  adapter: {
    type: 'VcfTabixAdapter',
    uri: 'https://example.com/cohort.vcf.gz',
    samplesTsvLocation: { uri: 'https://example.com/samples.tsv' },
  },
  displays: [
    {
      type: 'LinearMultiSampleVariantMatrixDisplay',
      height: 400,
      rowColor: 'population',
    },
  ],
}
```

Taller matrix filtering rare variants (MAF < 5 %). Row order, per-row color
and group labels come from the adapter's `samplesTsvLocation` above — the
display's own `layout` holds the arrangement the user then drags into place,
so it is session state rather than a config slot:

```js
{
  type: 'VariantTrack',
  trackId: 'cohort',
  name: 'Cohort variants',
  assemblyNames: ['hg38'],
  adapter: {
    type: 'VcfTabixAdapter',
    uri: 'https://example.com/cohort.vcf.gz',
  },
  displays: [
    {
      type: 'LinearMultiSampleVariantMatrixDisplay',
      height: 400,
      minorAlleleFrequencyFilter: 0.05,
    },
  ],
}
```

## Config slots

These slots go on a display entry: `"displays": [{ "type": "LinearMultiSampleVariantMatrixDisplay", ... }]`, or in the track's [`displayDefaults`](/docs/config_guides/tracks#configuring-displays) when this is its default display. Slot types (`fileLocation`, `frozen`, ...) are explained in the [config slot types reference](/docs/config_guides/slot_types). Slots a base configuration contributes are listed here too, so this table is the whole surface.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Slot | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <span id="slot-height">**height**</span><br>[`number`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#number) = <code>250</code> | Starting height in pixels for the whole display, including the lineZoneHeight band above the rows; drag-resizable, and the rows divide what is left over while row height is on auto-fit |
| <span id="slot-linezoneheight">**lineZoneHeight**</span><br>[`number`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#number) = <code>20</code> | Raises the shared slot's 0 default: this display lays columns out by feature index, so it needs the zone for the lines tying each column back to its genomic position. Drag-resizable, like `height`.<br>_advanced_ |
| <span class="slot-group">Inherited from [SharedVariantDisplay](../sharedvariantdisplay)</span> | <span class="slot-group-count">18 slots</span> |
| <span id="slot-showtooltips">**showTooltips**</span><br>[`boolean`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#boolean) = <code>true</code> | Show the hover tooltip naming the genotype, the sample and the record under the pointer. On by default; turning it off leaves every other hover affordance — the crosshairs, the highlighted cell, the cross-display `session.hovered` channel — alone, so the pointer still says where it is while the panel stops covering the rows beside it.<br><br>A config slot rather than a display property, so a track config can ship with it off and a figure capture keeps it off across a reload. Both multi-sample displays honor it: they draw the same tooltip off the same `hoveredFeature` slot. |
| <span id="slot-renderingmode">**renderingMode**</span><br>[`stringEnum`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#stringenum) (alleleCount, phased) = <code>'alleleCount'</code> | 'alleleCount' draws one row per sample colored by allele dosage; 'phased' draws one row per haplotype |
| <span id="slot-featurecolor">**featureColor**</span><br>[`string`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#string) = <code>''</code> | Optional per-feature color for the genotype cells: a jexl expression (or plain CSS color) evaluated once per variant in the worker, painting every alt-carrying cell with that color while ref/no-call cells keep their normal coloring so "who carries it" still reads. Empty means the default genotype-based coloring (allele dosage / phasing). The "Color by..." menu offers presets like consequence impact (`jexl:impactColor(feature)`), but any feature jexl works, same as the standard `color` slot.<br>_callback args:_ `feature` |
| <span id="slot-shadebydosage">**shadeByDosage**</span><br>[`boolean`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#boolean) = <code>true</code> | Compose the cell hue with the genotype's alt dosage — the fraction of its called alleles that are non-reference — so a homozygote paints the hue itself and a heterozygote a lighter version of it. On by default, and on in every color mode: turn it off to paint each alt-carrying cell its flat hue, which reads the class or impact tier at full strength at the cost of the zygosity. |
| <span id="slot-minorallelefrequencyfilter">**minorAlleleFrequencyFilter**</span><br>[`number`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#number) = <code>0</code> | Hide variants whose minor allele frequency is below this threshold<br>_advanced_ |
| <span id="slot-maxmissingnessfilter">**maxMissingnessFilter**</span><br>[`number`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#number) = <code>1</code> | Hide variants whose fraction of no-call (missing) genotypes is above this threshold; 1 keeps every variant<br>_advanced_ |
| <span id="slot-showlegend">**showLegend**</span><br>[`boolean`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#boolean) = <code>true</code> | Whether to draw the floating legend over the display. It is clipped to the display's own bounds, so while it is on it sets a floor under the lane height: turn it off to size a short lane to its rows rather than to its key, as for a one-record SV call genotyped across a handful of carriers. |
| <span id="slot-rowcolor">**rowColor**</span><br>[`string`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#string) = <code>''</code> | The tint is resolved when the rows are read, and while it is set it **wins over any color a row already carried** — a `color` column in the samplesTsv, one the arrangement dialog wrote, one an older session persisted. A channel bound to a variable beats a per-row constant; clear this to hand each row back its own color. |
| <span id="slot-facet">**facet**</span><br>[Facet](../facet) | A sample-metadata attribute (a column in the adapter's samplesTsvLocation, e.g. `"population"`) whose values each take their own band of rows, so a group-restricted genotype pattern reads as one band rather than being scattered across the matrix; or `{ field, domain }`, the listed values banding first and the rest sorted. Unset, the rows keep their existing order.<br><br>The band is applied when the rows are read, over whatever order the reader has arranged, so a drag that moves a sample into another band snaps back while this is set. It **yields while a cluster tree describes the rows** — the dendrogram positions leaf *i* on row *i*, so a band under it would draw it against the wrong rows. Clear the tree, or reset the row order, to band a clustered track. |
| <span id="slot-referencedrawingmode">**referenceDrawingMode**</span><br>[`stringEnum`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#stringenum) (draw, skip) = <code>'skip'</code> | Whether to paint reference alleles: 'skip' (the default) fills the row background solid grey and paints only ALT alleles, which makes overlapping variants easier to pick out; 'draw' paints reference alleles like any other genotype. |
| <span id="slot-jexlfilters">**jexlFilters**</span><br>`stringArray` = <code>[]</code> | default set of jexl filters to apply to a track. note: these do not use the jexl prefix because they have a deferred evaluation system |
| <span id="slot-rowheight">**rowHeight**</span><br>[`number`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#number) = <code>0</code> | per-row height in px, scrolling the rows that do not fit; 0 (the default) fits the rows to the display height instead, dividing it between them |
| <span id="slot-showtree">**showTree**</span><br>[`boolean`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#boolean) = <code>true</code> | Show the sample clustering tree in the sidebar |
| <span id="slot-showbranchlength">**showBranchLength**</span><br>[`boolean`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#boolean) = <code>true</code> | position tree nodes by branch length (dendrogram) rather than evenly by topology (cladogram) |
| <span id="slot-showrowlabels">**showRowLabels**</span><br>[`boolean`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#boolean) = <code>true</code> | Show the per-sample row labels in the sidebar |
| <span id="slot-treeareawidth">**treeAreaWidth**</span><br>[`number`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#number) = <code>80</code> | width in px of the tree sidebar, which a drag on its edge also writes |
| <span id="slot-domain">**domain**</span><br>`stringArray` = <code>[]</code> | Row order: the samples listed come first, in this order, and the rest keep the file's order; a facet groups within it. A clustering run rotates its dendrogram towards this order instead of discarding it, so the listed samples come as early as the tree allows |
| <span id="slot-showrowseparators">**showRowSeparators**</span><br>[`boolean`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#boolean) = <code>false</code> | draw a hairline between adjacent rows; off by default, because a painting whose neighbouring rows differ in color already separates itself and the line only earns its pixel where they do not — a run of same-colored rows reads as one block without it, with no way to recover the row count by eye. Drawn only once rows are at least 4px tall: below that the line is as thick as the row it borders, turning a dense painting into a grid of hairlines with a little color between them |

Off by default (the gate guards against huge downloads). Set it on a view no one can interact with — an embedded / notebook view, or a screenshot — where the region is known and you want it drawn without a click.<br>_advanced_ |
