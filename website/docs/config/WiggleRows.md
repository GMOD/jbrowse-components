Auto-generated from the config schema in the source — see the [config guide](/docs/config_guide) for concepts. Provided by the `wiggle` plugin. [View source](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/blob/main/plugins/wiggle/src/MultiQuantitativeTrack/wiggleRowsConfigSchema.ts).

The `rows` of a `LinearWiggleDisplay` on a `MultiQuantitativeTrack`: a
[QuantitativeRows](../quantitativerows) whose `field` defaults to `source`,
so each subtrack draws its own row.

## Example usage

```js
{ type: 'LinearWiggleDisplay', rows: { field: '' } }
```

## Config slots

Slot types (`fileLocation`, `frozen`, ...) are explained in the [config slot types reference](/docs/config_guides/slot_types). Slots a base configuration contributes are listed here too, so this table is the whole surface.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Slot | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <span id="slot-field">**field**</span><br>[`stringEnum`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#stringenum) ("", source) = <code>'source'</code> | `source` for one row per subtrack, or empty for one plot every source shares. Empty stays a value rather than unset, since under this default unset could not say "one plot every source shares". |
| <span class="slot-group">Inherited from [QuantitativeRows](../quantitativerows)</span> | <span class="slot-group-count">1 slot</span> |
| <span id="slot-filter">**filter**</span><br>[RowPredicate](../rowpredicate) | The rows shown by attribute: a list of [RowPredicate](../rowpredicate) entries over a subtrack's field, such as `group`, each one a row must pass, as `[{ field: 'group', equal: 'tumor' }]`. A row missing the attribute fails every test but `valid: false`. It narrows the rows before `kept`, and a write changing `field` keeps it, since it names no row by its value; a row's name goes in `kept`. |
| <span class="slot-group">Inherited from [Rows](../rows)</span> | <span class="slot-group-count">3 slots</span> |
| <span id="slot-axis">**axis**</span><br>[RowAxisWithGrid](../rowaxiswithgrid) | The guide down the left of the rows, a [RowAxisWithGrid](../rowaxiswithgrid): whether the tree and the row names draw, the sidebar's width, and a line between rows. What it draws is `rows.tree` and `rows.labels`. |
| <span id="slot-colors">**colors**</span><br>[`stringMap`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#stringmap) = <code>{}</code> | A color pinned on a row, by name, over whatever `rows.color` maps it to, as `labels` pins its text: ggplot2's `scale_*_manual(values = c(name = ...))`. The arrangement dialog's row swatches write it. A row with none takes `rows.color`, else the file's own color (MAF's `samples[].color`, a listed source's color), else the palette where the rows share one panel. |
| <span id="slot-color">**color**</span><br>[RowColor](../rowcolor) | The rows colored by an attribute: a [RowColor](../rowcolor) channel from a row field through a scale, `name` (each row) by default. Per-row colors are `rows.colors`, which win over it. |
| <span class="slot-group">Inherited from [RowArrangement](../rowarrangement)</span> | <span class="slot-group-count">4 slots</span> |
| <span id="slot-sort">**sort**</span><br>[`stringArray`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#stringarray) = <code>[]</code> | The row order, as Vega-Lite's `sort` lists it: the rows listed lead, in this order, and none is dropped. The rest keep the order their source lists them in (a VCF's samples, a multi-BigWig's subtracks), or sort, digits by magnitude, where the rows are values found on features. A clustering run, the arrangement dialog and "Sort rows here" all write it, and a run rotates its dendrogram towards it rather than discarding it. |
| <span id="slot-labels">**labels**</span><br>[`stringMap`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#stringmap) = <code>{}</code> | A label drawn beside a row in place of its name, by name. Whether any label draws is `rows.axis.labels`. |
| <span id="slot-tree">**tree**</span><br>[RowTree](../rowtree) | The dendrogram beside the rows, a [RowTree](../rowtree): newick, or `{ newick, provenance }` where a clustering run wrote it beside the order it produced. A reorder that moves a row drops it. Whether it draws is `rows.axis.tree`. |
| <span id="slot-kept">**kept**</span><br>[`stringArray`](/docs/config_guides/slot_types#stringarray) = <code>[]</code> | The rows shown, by name: a clade picked off the tree, or the rows one key row stands for. It narrows the rows to those it names, after `filter` where the display declares one; empty shows every row, and a list naming no current row shows none, with a notice. Keyed: a write changing `field` clears it. |
