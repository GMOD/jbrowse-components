import Figure from '../../figure'

External plugins can be added to the configuration like so:

```json

```

Any tools that are available via that plugin will then be added to JBrowse. You can verify the plugin is installed properly by checking the Plugin Store:

<Figure />

If you have an unpublished plugin running locally, you can add that plugin to your configuration using the localhost:

```json

```

Checkout our [developer guides](/) for more information on developing plugins, or our [plugins page](/plugins) to browse currently published plugins.
