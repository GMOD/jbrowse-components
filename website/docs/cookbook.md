  'Copy-paste recipes for the most common JBrowse 2 configuration tasks: colors,
  labels, tooltips, tracks, themes, and more'
---

Short, copy-paste recipes for the `config.json` settings people reach for most.
Examples use the `volvox` sample data
([`test_data/volvox`](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/tree/main/test_data/volvox))
so you can try them directly. For the full reference, see the
[Config guide](/docs/config_guide).

**New here?** Read the [TL;DR](#tldr-a-complete-config-on-one-screen) and
[shorthand](#how-config-shorthand-works) sections first, then use the **"On this
page"** panel (top right) to jump to a recipe.

## TL;DR: a complete config on one screen {#tldr-a-complete-config-on-one-screen}

A full, working `config.json`: one assembly, four tracks, an opening view, and a
theme, written with all the shorthand JBrowse allows. Read it for the shape of a
config, then skim on: every section after it zooms in on one piece.

```json
{
  "assemblies": [{ "name": "volvox", "uri": "volvox.2bit" }],
  "tracks": [
    {
      "type": "FeatureTrack",
      "trackId": "genes",
      "name": "Genes",
      "category": ["Annotation"],
      "assemblyNames": ["volvox"],
      "adapter": { "type": "Gff3TabixAdapter", "uri": "volvox.sort.gff3.gz" },
      "displayDefaults": {
        "color": "jexl:feature.strand==1?'#1f77b4':'#d62728'",
        "height": 200,
        "mouseover": "jexl:feature.name"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "FeatureTrack",
      "trackId": "regions",
      "name": "Regions of interest",
      "category": ["Annotation"],
      "assemblyNames": ["volvox"],
      "adapter": { "type": "BedTabixAdapter", "uri": "volvox-bed12.bed.gz" },
      "displayDefaults": { "color": "#6a3d9a" }
    },
    {
      "type": "AlignmentsTrack",
      "trackId": "reads",
      "name": "Reads",
      "assemblyNames": ["volvox"],
      "adapter": { "type": "BamAdapter", "uri": "volvox-sorted.bam" },
      "displayDefaults": {
        "heightMode": "fit",
        "colorBy": { "type": "mappingQuality" }
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "QuantitativeTrack",
      "trackId": "coverage",
      "name": "Coverage",
      "assemblyNames": ["volvox"],
      "adapter": { "type": "BigWigAdapter", "uri": "volvox_microarray.bw" },
      "displayDefaults": { "color": "#C8B414", "scaleType": "log" }
    }
  ],
  "defaultSession": {
    "name": "My session",
    "views": [
      {
        "type": "LinearGenomeView",
        "init": {
          "loc": "ctgA:1-50000",
          "assembly": "volvox",
          "tracks": ["genes", "regions", "reads", "coverage"]
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "configuration": {
    "theme": {
      "palette": {
        "primary": { "main": "#311b92" },
        "secondary": { "main": "#0097a7" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Nearly everything there is a plain CSS color, a `jexl:` one-liner, or a bare
`uri`: no index paths, no display IDs, no renderer names, and the next section
explains why. You can go smaller still, since one assembly plus one track, with
no `defaultSession` and no theme, is already a complete config.

---

## How config shorthand works {#how-config-shorthand-works}

JBrowse expands a few kinds of **shorthand** at load time (a config
`preProcessSnapshot` step), so you only write the parts that matter.

### Adapter `uri` shorthand

Write the data file once as `uri` and JBrowse fills in the companion index and
location slot:

```json
{ "type": "BamAdapter", "uri": "sample.bam" }
```

expands to the full form:

```json
{
  "type": "BamAdapter",
  "bamLocation": { "uri": "sample.bam" },
  "index": { "location": { "uri": "sample.bam.bai" } }
}
```

The index name is inferred from the adapter: `.bam` → `.bam.bai`, `.cram` →
`.cram.crai`, and bgzip+tabix files (`.vcf.gz`, `.gff3.gz`, `.bed.gz`) → `.tbi`.

Use the **full form** only when the shorthand guesses wrong, e.g. a `.csi`
index, or an index whose name doesn't follow `file + .bai/.crai/.tbi`:

```json
{
  "type": "BamAdapter",
  "bamLocation": { "uri": "sample.bam" },
  "index": {
    "indexType": "CSI",
    "location": { "uri": "sample.bam.csi" }
  }
}
```

A location is a `{ "uri": "..." }` object. You almost never need the
`"locationType"` field, which JBrowse infers (local desktop files use
`{ "localPath": "..." }` instead). See
[supported file types](/docs/config_guides/file_types) for every format's `uri`
shorthand.

### Assembly `{ name, uri }` shorthand

An assembly is, at its flattest, just a `name` and a sequence-file `uri`:

```json
{ "name": "volvox", "uri": "volvox.2bit" }
```

expands to the full assembly. JBrowse picks the adapter from the file extension
(`.2bit` → `TwoBitAdapter`, `.fa.gz` → `BgzipFastaAdapter`, `.fa` →
`IndexedFastaAdapter`), derives the `.fai`/`.gzi` index siblings, and fills in
the `ReferenceSequenceTrack`:

```json
{
  "name": "volvox",
  "sequence": {
    "type": "ReferenceSequenceTrack",
    "trackId": "volvox-ReferenceSequenceTrack",
    "adapter": { "type": "TwoBitAdapter", "uri": "volvox.2bit" }
  }
}
```

`refNameAliases` and `cytobands` take the same bare `{ "uri": "..." }`:

```json
{
  "name": "hg38",
  "uri": "hg38.fa.gz",
  "refNameAliases": { "uri": "hg38.aliases.txt" },
  "cytobands": { "uri": "hg38.cytoBand.txt" }
}
```

Keep the `uri` _key_ (rather than a bare string) so relative uris still resolve
against the config's location. If you only want to drop the `type`/`trackId`
boilerplate but need extra adapter fields (a `chromSizesLocation` for a 2bit, a
non-sibling `.fai`), write the adapter out and let its own `uri` shorthand fill
in the rest: `"sequence": { "adapter": { "uri": "volvox.2bit" } }`. See the
[`BaseAssembly` config](/docs/config/baseassembly) for every form.

### `displayDefaults` shorthand

Appearance lives on a track's **displays** (the ways it can be drawn). Put
color, height, labels, and scale in `displayDefaults` and JBrowse routes each
setting to the right display, so you never have to name the display or write a
`displays` array:

```json
"displayDefaults": { "color": "green", "height": 200 }
```

expands to:

```json
"displays": [
  {
    "type": "LinearBasicDisplay",
    "displayId": "<trackId>-LinearBasicDisplay",
    "color": "green",
    "height": 200
  }
]
```

If a track can be drawn more than one way, each setting lands where it fits. For
example, a `VariantTrack` uses `color` for its linear display and `strokeColor`
for its circular one, both in the same object. A setting nothing uses is ignored
with a console warning, so typos surface.

Reach for the **full `displays` array** only when you need precise control:
selecting a non-default display type (like the
[arc display](#draw-features-as-arcs-with-a-jexl-computed-height) below), two
displays with different values, or a fixed `displayId`. Everything else,
including `mouseover` and `jexlFilters`, routes through `displayDefaults`.

### `jexl:` callbacks

Any slot value starting with `jexl:` is a per-feature callback. Read attributes
as plain properties (`feature.type`, `feature.strand`, `feature.INFO.SVTYPE`):

```json
"color": "jexl:feature.strand==1?'blue':'red'"
```

See [using jexl callbacks](/docs/config_guides/jexl) for the full function
catalog.

### The same settings work in config, session, URL, and embeds

Everything on this page is either a `displayDefaults` object or a view
definition, and neither one is tied to `config.json`. JBrowse treats config and
session as the same vocabulary, so the identical object works in four places:

- in **`config.json`**, as a track's `displayDefaults` and a `defaultSession`,
  so it loads for everyone
- in a **URL**, as a `session=spec-…` or a track's `displaySnapshot`, so you can
  hand one view to one person (see
  [from config to a URL](#from-config-to-a-url))
- in an **embedded component**, passed to `createViewState`, so it renders
  inside your own web page
- in the **running app**, where the track menu writes those same slots back out
  when you change a color or a height by hand

So a color callback or a `heightMode` you work out here is never throwaway. The
recipes below are written as `config.json` because that's the easiest form to
read, but read "config" as "config, session, URL, or embed" throughout.

That last bullet is often the fastest route: tune a track by clicking in the
running app until it looks right, then read the JSON back out. A track's
**About** dialog has a **Copy config** button that gives you that track's config
with your session tweaks folded in, and **File ▸ Export session** does the same
for the whole view. Both paste straight into `config.json`.

---

## Getting data in fast (CLI)

The CLI is the quickest path to a working instance: it writes the config for
you. See the [web quickstart](/docs/quickstart_web).

```bash
jbrowse create jbrowse2 && cd jbrowse2
samtools faidx genome.fa && jbrowse add-assembly genome.fa --load copy
samtools index file.bam && jbrowse add-track file.bam --load copy
bgzip file.vcf && tabix file.vcf.gz && jbrowse add-track file.vcf.gz --load copy
jbrowse text-index      # build search index for gene names
npx serve -S .          # serve locally
```

Everything below is the config those commands generate, which you can also
hand-edit.

### Applying a recipe from the CLI

Every recipe on this page is reachable from `jbrowse add-track` without
hand-editing the config. `--color` and `--height` are shortcuts for the two most
common `displayDefaults` settings, so the "color by strand" recipe is just:

```bash
jbrowse add-track genes.gff3.gz --load copy --name Genes \
  --color 'jexl:feature.strand==1?"blue":"red"' --height 200
```

Wrap the value in single quotes and use double quotes _inside_ the jexl, so
there's nothing to escape. Anything else lands in a catch-all flag that takes
inline JSON, as in this labels-and-tooltips example:

```bash
jbrowse add-track genes.gff3.gz --load copy \
  --displayDefaults '{"mouseover":"jexl:feature.name","labels":{"description":"jexl:feature.note"}}'
```

Four `add-track` flags carry every appearance recipe on this page:

| To set                                                                                                            | Flag                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Color or height                                                                                                   | `--color`, `--height`        |
| Any other display setting: labels, tooltips, `jexlFilters`, `colorBy`, `groupBy`, `scaleType`, `defaultRendering` | `--displayDefaults '<json>'` |
| A non-default display (arc, matrix), or a top-level field like `metadata`/`formatDetails`                         | `--config '<json>'`          |
| Track-selector folders                                                                                            | `--category "RNA-seq,Brain"` |

To change a setting on a track you already added, re-run the same command with
the new flag plus `--force`, which overwrites the existing entry.

`jbrowse admin-server` is the other route: it serves your instance with the
config-editing UI on, so settings you change in the browser are written back to
`config.json` on disk. Run it locally only, never on a public port.

A few settings aren't per-track. Alias chromosome names when you add the
assembly:

```bash
jbrowse add-assembly genome.fa.gz --load copy --refNameAliases aliases.txt
```

And open JBrowse to a curated view by writing the `defaultSession` from a file,
which takes the same shape as the
[TL;DR config's](#tldr-a-complete-config-on-one-screen) `defaultSession` (the
`init` shorthand works here too):

```bash
echo '{"views":[{"type":"LinearGenomeView","init":{"assembly":"volvox","loc":"ctgA:1-50000","tracks":["genes","coverage"]}}]}' > session.json
jbrowse set-default-session --session session.json
```

The [multi-signal wiggle](#multiple-signals-on-one-track-each-its-own-color) is
the one recipe that bundles several files into one track, so it takes a
`--multiwig` flag in place of the positional track argument (see that recipe for
the details).

See the [CLI reference](/docs/cli) for every flag.

### Rendering a recipe as a static image

To turn a recipe into a PNG or SVG without building a browsable instance, reach
for [`@jbrowse/img`](/docs/jbrowse-img) (the `jb2export` command). It renders
straight from your files and takes the same settings inline as per-track tokens
(`color:`, `height:`, `sort:base`, `display:multivariant`), and has its own
`--multiwig` flag too. Use it for a figure; use `jbrowse add-track` when you
want a config someone can open and explore.

---

## Assemblies

### Reference sequence adapters

Pick the adapter that matches your file. All three do the same job:

```json
{ "type": "TwoBitAdapter", "uri": "genome.2bit" }
```

```json
{ "type": "BgzipFastaAdapter", "uri": "genome.fa.gz" }
```

```json
{ "type": "IndexedFastaAdapter", "uri": "genome.fa" }
```

`BgzipFastaAdapter` (from `bgzip genome.fa` + `samtools faidx genome.fa.gz`) is
recommended for large genomes.

### Refname aliases (chr1 vs 1 vs NC_000001)

Map alternative chromosome names so tracks that use different conventions line
up. Point at a two-column file (chromAliases) with the `uri` shorthand:

```json
{
  "name": "volvox",
  "uri": "volvox.2bit",
  "refNameAliases": { "uri": "volvox.chromAliases.txt" }
}
```

or list them inline with a `FromConfigAdapter`:

```json
{
  "name": "volvox",
  "sequence": { "...": "..." },
  "refNameAliases": {
    "adapter": {
      "type": "FromConfigAdapter",
      "features": [
        { "refName": "ctgA", "uniqueId": "a1", "aliases": ["contigA", "A"] },
        { "refName": "ctgB", "uniqueId": "a2", "aliases": ["contigB", "B"] }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

See [assemblies](/docs/config_guides/assemblies) for the file-based form.

---

## Colors

**The one thing to know:** a track's color is the `color` setting in
`displayDefaults`, either a plain CSS color or a `jexl:` expression JBrowse runs
per feature, returning that feature's color.

Three routes write that same slot, so pick whichever fits how you work:

```bash
# CLI: set it when you add the track
jbrowse add-track genes.gff3.gz --load copy --color '#6a3d9a'

# ...or recolor a track already in the config by re-running with --force
jbrowse add-track genes.gff3.gz --load copy --color 'jexl:feature.strand==1?"blue":"red"' --force
```

In the running app, a feature track's **Color by...** submenu has **Solid
color...** (a picker) plus **Strand** and per-attribute choices, and a wiggle
track has **Edit color...**; **About ▸ Copy config** then gives you the JSON. Or
edit `displayDefaults` by hand, which is what the rest of this section shows.

### What you can color by

A `jexl:` color expression sees the feature as `feature`, with any attribute
readable as a plain property. Most-used:

| Read this               | What it is                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `feature.type`          | GFF3/BED type: `gene`, `mRNA`, `CDS`, `exon`, …  |
| `feature.strand`        | `1` (+), `-1` (−), or `0` (none)                 |
| `feature.score`         | numeric score (BED/GFF3 score column, wig value) |
| `feature.name`          | display name                                     |
| `feature.start`         | start coordinate (0-based half-open)             |
| `feature.end`           | end coordinate                                   |
| `feature.refName`       | chromosome / contig name                         |
| `feature.INFO.SVTYPE`   | any VCF `INFO` field (variants)                  |
| `getTag(feature, 'HP')` | any BAM/CRAM tag: `HP`, `RG`, `MD`, …            |
| `feature.parent`        | parent feature (e.g. the gene of an mRNA)        |
| `feature.itemRgb`       | BED12/bigBed named columns (see caveat below)    |

The full property and function list is in
[using jexl callbacks](/docs/config_guides/jexl).

### A complete example: color by strand {#color-by-strand}

Every recipe below is the same track with a different `displayDefaults.color`
(or, for alignments/variants, `colorBy`). Here's the full track for **color by
strand**; the table after it shows just the line to swap for everything else:

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureTrack",
  "trackId": "genes_by_strand",
  "name": "Genes (colored by strand)",
  "assemblyNames": ["volvox"],
  "adapter": { "type": "Gff3TabixAdapter", "uri": "volvox.sort.gff3.gz" },
  "displayDefaults": { "color": "jexl:feature.strand==1?'#1f77b4':'#d62728'" }
}
```

### More ways to set `color`

Drop any of these into the same `displayDefaults` in place of the line above.
The first six are `FeatureTrack` recipes; the last two are for `AlignmentsTrack`
and `VariantTrack`, whose color slot works the same way.

| Recipe                            | `displayDefaults`                                                                             | Notes                                            |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Solid color                       | `{ "color": "#6a3d9a" }`                                                                      | any CSS color: hex, `rgb()`/`hsl()`, or a name   |
| By feature type (lookup table)    | `{ "color": "jexl:{CDS:'#d62728',exon:'#2ca02c',gene:'#1f77b4'}[feature.type] \|\| 'gray'" }` | `\|\| 'gray'` catches anything not listed        |
| By a numeric threshold            | `{ "color": "jexl:feature.score > 7.3 ? 'red' : '#0068d1'" }`                                 | a hard cutoff, not a gradient                    |
| Continuous gradient from a number | ``{ "color": "jexl:`hsl(${feature.score*3},50%,50%)`" }``                                     | maps `feature.score` onto an HSL hue             |
| Auto color per category           | `{ "color": "jexl:randomColor(feature.type)" }`                                               | same string always gets the same color           |
| BED file's own colors (`itemRgb`) | `{ "color": "jexl:feature.itemRgb \|\| 'gray'" }`                                             | only guaranteed for BED12/bigBed (see note)      |
| BAM/CRAM tag (`AlignmentsTrack`)  | `{ "colorBy": { "type": "tag", "tag": "HP" } }`                                               | built-in, reads the tag and picks colors         |
| SNPs vs indels (`VariantTrack`)   | `{ "color": "jexl:feature.type=='SNV'?'green':'purple'" }`                                    | branch on `feature.type` or any VCF `INFO` field |

A few of these need more than the one line above:

- **BED `itemRgb`** is only guaranteed for **BED12**, **bigBed**, or a track
  given an `autoSql`/`columnNames`. On a plaintext BED with fewer columns the
  extra columns surface generically as `field6`, `field7`, and so on. See the
  BED column-names note in
  [customizing feature colors](/docs/config_guides/customizing_feature_colors).
- **Auto color per category**: `randomColor`, `alpha`, `hsl`, `colorString`, and
  `interpolate` are the built-in [color helpers](/docs/config_guides/jexl) in
  the jexl catalog, e.g. `alpha('#1f77b4', 0.4)` for a semi-transparent fill
  where features overlap.
- **BAM/CRAM tag**: other `colorBy` schemes (`mappingQuality`, `strand`,
  `pairOrientation`, `insertSize`, `modifications`) are in
  [alignments tracks](#alignments-tracks). To color by a tag on a `FeatureTrack`
  instead, read it in jexl with `getTag`, which smooths over BAM/CRAM tag
  differences: `"color": "jexl:getTag(feature, 'HP')==1?'crimson':'steelblue'"`.
- If the callback outgrows a one-liner (**plugin function**), move it into a
  small plugin that registers a jexl function (e.g. `colorFeature`) and call it
  by name: `{ "color": "jexl:colorFeature(feature)" }`. This needs a companion
  `plugins` array registering `colorFeature`; see
  [customizing feature colors](/docs/config_guides/customizing_feature_colors)
  for the full plugin file.

The lookup table scales past `feature.type`: key it on any field the track
exposes. UCSC RepeatMasker carries a `repClass` column, so one table colors
every repeat by its class:

```json
{
  "color": "jexl:{SINE:'#e41a1c',LINE:'#377eb8',LTR:'#4daf4a',DNA:'#984ea3',Simple_repeat:'#ff7f00',Low_complexity:'#a65628'}[get(feature,'repClass')] || 'gray'"
}
```

`get(feature, 'repClass')` reads a BED column the same way `feature.type` reads
a GFF type, and `|| 'gray'` catches the classes not in the table.

<Figure caption="UCSC RepeatMasker over a 17q21 window with the lookup table above: every repeat takes the color of its repClass, and classes not in the table fall through to gray." src="/img/cookbook_color_by_type.png"/>

### Debugging a color callback

Two things catch most mistakes:

- Wrap the expression in `log(...)` to print the value it returns for each
  feature to the browser console: `"color": "jexl:log(feature.type)"` (or
  `log(...)` around the whole expression, which prints and passes the value
  through). See the `log` function in the
  [jexl catalog](/docs/config_guides/jexl).
- If a `displayDefaults` key routes to no display, JBrowse ignores it with a
  console warning, so a mistyped `colour` or `colorBy` surfaces there rather
  than failing silently.

## Labels, tooltips & details

These all build on the [canonical track above](#color-by-strand): same
`assemblyNames`/`adapter`, only `displayDefaults` (or `formatDetails`) changes.

### Labels

Labels route through `displayDefaults` exactly like `color`:

- Fallback name (first non-empty wins):
  `"labels": { "name": "jexl:feature.name || feature.id" }`
- Composite label:
  `"labels": { "name": "jexl:feature.name+' ['+feature.type+']'" }`
- Description shown under the name:

  ```json
  "displayDefaults": {
    "labels": {
      "name": "jexl:feature.name || feature.id",
      "description": "jexl:feature.note || feature.description || ''"
    },
    "showLabels": true,
    "showDescriptions": true
  }
  ```

### Tooltips (mouseover)

`mouseover` is a per-feature callback whose returned string shows on hover, same
as color and labels:

```json
"displayDefaults": {
  "mouseover": "jexl:`${feature.name} [${feature.type}] ${feature.start}-${feature.end}`"
}
```

Reach subfeature attributes through `feature.parent` (e.g.
`feature.parent.name`). Tooltips render the returned string as HTML, so you can
include `<b>`, `<br/>`, and links.

### Customizing the feature details panel {#customizing-the-feature-details-panel}

Clicking a feature opens a details panel shaped by the track's `formatDetails`
slot, which sits at the top level of the track, not in `displayDefaults`. Its
`feature` callback returns an object that gets merged into what's shown: name a
field to rewrite it (say, turn `name` into a link), add a new field to slip in
an extra row, or set one to `undefined` to hide it.

```json
"formatDetails": {
  "feature": "jexl:{name:'<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term='+feature.name+'>'+feature.name+'</a>', type:undefined}"
}
```

Use `subfeatures` (with `depth`) to reshape subfeature rows the same way. See
[customizing feature details](/docs/config_guides/customizing_feature_details).

## Feature tracks

### GFF3, BED, or bigBed genes

Each is the same track with a different adapter:

```json
{ "type": "Gff3TabixAdapter", "uri": "volvox.sort.gff3.gz" }
```

```json
{ "type": "BedTabixAdapter", "uri": "volvox-bed12.bed.gz" }
```

```json
{ "type": "BigBedAdapter", "uri": "volvox.bb" }
```

For a **small, unindexed** file (no bgzip/tabix needed) use the plaintext
adapter (`Gff3Adapter`, `BedAdapter`, or `VcfAdapter`), which reads the whole
file into memory:

```json
{ "type": "Gff3Adapter", "uri": "volvox.sort.gff3" }
```

Or skip files entirely and embed a handful of features straight in the config
with `FromConfigAdapter`, handy for demos, tests, or annotations you maintain by
hand. See [inline data](#inline-data-no-files) below.

### Set the drawing height

```json
"displayDefaults": { "height": 200 }
```

### Fit, grow, or fix the track height

`height` sets the box the track lives in. `heightMode` decides what happens when
there are more features than fit that box:

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureTrack",
  "trackId": "genes",
  "name": "Genes",
  "assemblyNames": ["volvox"],
  "adapter": { "type": "Gff3TabixAdapter", "uri": "volvox.sort.gff3.gz" },
  "displayDefaults": { "height": 200, "heightMode": "fit" }
}
```

- `fixed` (the default) keeps the height you set and scrolls the overflow
- `grow` expands the track downward until every feature shows, no scrollbar
- `fit` shrinks the features themselves so the whole stack fits the current
  height

`fit` is the one people go looking for: it's how you get a full pileup or a
dense annotation into a screenshot without a scrollbar cutting it off. The same
slot lives on alignments tracks too (it's the "Track sizing" menu on any track).

### Pack features onto fewer rows

`displayMode` controls how much vertical room each feature gets, independent of
the track height above. `collapsed` drops everything onto a single row with
labels off, which is handy for a repeat or mappability track you just want as a
thin stripe:

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureTrack",
  "trackId": "repeats",
  "name": "Repeats",
  "assemblyNames": ["volvox"],
  "adapter": { "type": "BedTabixAdapter", "uri": "volvox-bed12.bed.gz" },
  "displayDefaults": { "displayMode": "collapsed" }
}
```

`normal` is the default, and `compact` or `superCompact` sit in between,
shrinking the rows without fully flattening them.

### Draw features as arcs, with a jexl-computed height

Useful for interactions, breakpoints, or paired features. The arc display isn't
a `FeatureTrack`'s default, so select it with a `displays` array. Its appearance
slots (`color`, `arcHeight`, `thickness`, `label`) sit directly on the display,
each accepting a `jexl:` expression:

```json
"displays": [
  {
    "type": "LinearArcDisplay",
    "displayId": "arcs-LinearArcDisplay",
    "arcHeight": "jexl:log10(feature.end-feature.start)*20"
  }
]
```

See the [`LinearArcDisplay` config](/docs/config/lineararcdisplay) for every arc
slot.

### Showing only some features (filtering) {#showing-only-some-features-filtering}

`jexlFilters` shows only features that pass every expression listed. One gotcha:
unlike `color`, filter expressions **leave off the `jexl:` prefix** (they use a
deferred-evaluation convention).

```json
"displayDefaults": {
  "jexlFilters": [
    "feature.end - feature.start > 1000",
    "feature.type == 'gene'"
  ]
}
```

The same `jexlFilters` works on variant and alignments tracks. To hide reads by
their SAM flags instead, see
[filter reads by SAM flag or tag](#filter-reads-by-sam-flag-or-tag).

### Inline data (no files)

`FromConfigAdapter` embeds features directly in the config:

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureTrack",
  "trackId": "inline_features",
  "name": "Inline features",
  "assemblyNames": ["volvox"],
  "adapter": {
    "type": "FromConfigAdapter",
    "features": [
      {
        "uniqueId": "f1",
        "refName": "ctgA",
        "start": 190,
        "end": 400,
        "name": "SE_001",
        "type": "gene"
      },
      {
        "uniqueId": "f2",
        "refName": "ctgA",
        "start": 191,
        "end": 300,
        "name": "SE_002",
        "type": "gene"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See [FromConfig adapters](/docs/config_guides/from_config).

---

## Alignments tracks

### Color reads by mapping quality (or other schemes) and set a taller height

`colorBy` and `height` are display settings, so they go in `displayDefaults`:

```json
{
  "type": "AlignmentsTrack",
  "trackId": "my_bam",
  "name": "My alignments",
  "assemblyNames": ["volvox"],
  "adapter": { "type": "BamAdapter", "uri": "volvox-sorted.bam" },
  "displayDefaults": { "height": 400, "colorBy": { "type": "mappingQuality" } }
}
```

Other `colorBy` types include `strand`, `pairOrientation`, `insertSize`, and
`modifications` (for methylation). CRAM uses the `CramAdapter` in place of
`BamAdapter`.

### Show soft-clipping and group the pileup

`showSoftClipping` and `groupBy` are both display settings on the same track
above. This draws soft-clipped bases and stacks reads into haplotype groups by
their `HP` tag:

```json
"displayDefaults": {
  "showSoftClipping": true,
  "groupBy": { "type": "tag", "tag": "HP" }
}
```

`groupBy` also takes `{ "type": "strand" }` to split the pileup by strand.

### Filter reads by SAM flag or tag

`filterBy` drops reads before they're drawn. `flagExclude` hides reads with any
of those bits set, `flagInclude` keeps only reads with all of them. The default
excludes 1540 (unmapped, vendor-failed, duplicate); adding 256 and 2048 also
hides secondary and supplementary alignments:

```json
"displayDefaults": { "filterBy": { "flagExclude": 3844, "flagInclude": 0 } }
```

`flagInclude: 2` is "proper pairs only". `tagFilters` restricts by tag value
instead, and every filter listed has to pass:

```json
"displayDefaults": {
  "filterBy": { "flagExclude": 1540, "flagInclude": 0, "tagFilters": [{ "tag": "HP", "value": "1" }] }
}
```

[Broad's flag explainer](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html)
adds up a number for you. To filter on a feature property rather than a flag,
use [`jexlFilters`](#showing-only-some-features-filtering); see
[alignments tracks](/docs/config_guides/alignments_track) for the other
read-filtering options.

### Limit how much data is fetched

```json
"adapter": { "type": "CramAdapter", "uri": "big.cram", "fetchSizeLimit": 1000 }
```

---

## Quantitative (wiggle) tracks

### BigWig with a custom color

```json
{
  "type": "QuantitativeTrack",
  "trackId": "coverage",
  "name": "Coverage",
  "assemblyNames": ["volvox"],
  "adapter": { "type": "BigWigAdapter", "uri": "volvox_microarray.bw" },
  "displayDefaults": { "color": "#C8B414" }
}
```

A bare `color` is shorthand for single-color mode. Left alone a wiggle is
**bicolor**: scores above the pivot draw in `posColor` and grow upward, below it
in `negColor` and grow downward. Name those two to keep that and recolor both
halves:

```json
"displayDefaults": { "posColor": "#C8B414", "negColor": "#4a7ebb" }
```

`bicolorPivot` moves where they split. Write `color` or `posColor`/`negColor`,
never both: with a pos/neg pair present `color` goes unused, and density
rendering always draws from `posColor`.

All three are plain CSS colors. A wiggle colors per signal, not per feature, so
the [color expressions above](#more-ways-to-set-color) don't apply; for one
color per signal see the
[multi-signal recipe](#multiple-signals-on-one-track-each-its-own-color).

### Draw it as a density, line, or scatter plot

```json
"displayDefaults": { "defaultRendering": "density" }
```

[`defaultRendering`](/docs/config/linearwiggledisplay/#slot-defaultrendering)
also takes `xyplot` (bars, the default), `line` and `linecenter` (step and
interpolated lines), and `scatter` (one point per value, good for BAF or CN
points). `density` draws a heatmap stripe rather than a plot, which suits a
short track. The
[multi-signal recipe](#multiple-signals-on-one-track-each-its-own-color) has the
`multi*` equivalents.

### Log scale and a fixed score range

```json
"displayDefaults": { "scaleType": "log", "minScore": 0, "maxScore": 100 }
```

See the [`LinearWiggleDisplay` config](/docs/config/linearwiggledisplay) for
`scaleType`, `minScore`/`maxScore`, and the other scale slots, and the
[quantitative track guide](/docs/config_guides/quantitative_track) for concepts.

### Multiple signals on one track, each its own color

```json
{
  "type": "MultiQuantitativeTrack",
  "trackId": "multiwig",
  "name": "Grains",
  "assemblyNames": ["volvox"],
  "adapter": {
    "type": "MultiWiggleAdapter",
    "subadapters": [
      {
        "type": "BigWigAdapter",
        "name": "Grain1",
        "uri": "v1.cram.bw",
        "color": "#f00"
      },
      {
        "type": "BigWigAdapter",
        "name": "Grain2",
        "uri": "v2.cram.bw",
        "color": "#f60"
      },
      {
        "type": "BigWigAdapter",
        "name": "Grain3",
        "uri": "v3.cram.bw",
        "color": "#fa0"
      }
    ]
  },
  "displayDefaults": { "defaultRendering": "multiline" }
}
```

`multiline` overlays every signal as a line in one plot. The
[`defaultRendering`](/docs/config/multilinearwiggledisplay/#slot-defaultrendering)
slot takes a `multirow*` name to stack one row per signal (`multirowxy`,
`multirowdensity`, `multirowline`, `multirowlinecenter`, `multirowscatter`) or a
`multi*` name to overlay them all in one plot (`multixyplot`, `multiline`,
`multilinecenter`, `multiscatter`).

From the CLI, `add-track --multiwig` builds this track. Pass the per-row
`name`/`color` subadapters above as a `.json` sources file, or a bare
comma-separated list for quick unnamed signals:

```bash
jbrowse add-track --multiwig v1.cram.bw,v2.cram.bw,v3.cram.bw --load copy --name Grains
```

<Figure caption="A three-sample MultiQuantitativeTrack over the AMY1 cluster (multirowxy): each 1000 Genomes sample's copy number draws in its own color and varies across the locus." src="/img/cookbook_multiwig.png"/>

---

## Variant tracks

### Filter which variants are shown

Apply `jexl` filters so only matching features render (as in
[filtering](#showing-only-some-features-filtering), `jexlFilters` entries omit
the `jexl:` prefix while `color` keeps it):

```json
"displayDefaults": {
  "jexlFilters": ["feature.start<8000"],
  "color": "jexl:feature.start>5000?'darkgreen':'red'"
}
```

Multi-sample VCFs open in the standard variant display. To see genotypes as a
grid, switch to the genotype-matrix display from the track menu, or select it in
the config:

```json
"displays": [{ "type": "LinearMultiSampleVariantMatrixDisplay" }]
```

See [variant tracks](/docs/config_guides/variant_track).

---

## Synteny and dotplot tracks {#synteny-and-dotplot-tracks}

A `SyntenyTrack` lines up two assemblies from a whole-genome alignment and feeds
both the dotplot and linear-synteny views. Pick the adapter that matches your
aligner: `PAFAdapter` for minimap2/wfmash, `DeltaAdapter` for MUMmer,
`ChainAdapter` for liftOver/lastz.

The thing everyone trips on is which assembly is which. minimap2 takes its
inputs **target first**:

```bash
minimap2 grape.fa peach.fa > out.paf   # minimap2 target.fa query.fa
```

so here the **target is grape** and the **query is peach**. Name them outright
with `queryAssembly` and `targetAssembly` on the adapter instead of tracking the
order yourself:

```json
{
  "type": "SyntenyTrack",
  "trackId": "grape_peach_synteny",
  "name": "Grape vs Peach",
  "assemblyNames": ["peach", "grape"],
  "adapter": {
    "type": "PAFAdapter",
    "uri": "out.paf",
    "queryAssembly": "peach",
    "targetAssembly": "grape"
  }
}
```

The query is drawn on the dotplot's horizontal axis (the top row in linear
synteny), the target on the vertical axis (bottom row). Both assemblies must
already exist in `assemblies`.

**Track loads blank?** That's almost always swapped assemblies: the alignment's
coordinates don't line up with the assemblies on screen, so nothing draws. Flip
`queryAssembly` and `targetAssembly` (or, if you used the positional
`assemblyNames: [query, target]` array instead, reverse it).

To open a dotplot or linear synteny view pointed at this track, see the
[synteny track guide](/docs/config_guides/synteny_track) and the
[synteny visualization tutorial](/docs/tutorials/synteny_visualization).

---

## Instance-wide settings

These apply to the whole JBrowse instance, rather than one track.

### Group tracks in the selector with categories

```json
"category": ["RNA-seq", "Brain"]
```

Nested arrays create nested folders in the
[hierarchical track selector](/docs/config_guides/track_selector).

### Add metadata shown in the track details

```json
"metadata": {
  "description": "150bp paired-end reads",
  "source": "See <a href='https://example.com'>the paper</a>"
}
```

### Text searching (gene name search)

Build an index with `jbrowse text-index`, then reference it so the search box
can jump to genes by name:

```json
"aggregateTextSearchAdapters": [
  {
    "type": "TrixTextSearchAdapter",
    "textSearchAdapterId": "volvox-index",
    "ixFilePath": { "uri": "trix/volvox.ix" },
    "ixxFilePath": { "uri": "trix/volvox.ixx" },
    "metaFilePath": { "uri": "trix/volvox_meta.json" },
    "assemblyNames": ["volvox"]
  }
]
```

See [text searching](/docs/config_guides/text_searching).

### Theming

Set `configuration.theme.palette`. `primary` and `secondary` drive the toolbars
and highlights, and `tertiary`/`quaternary` handle accents:

```json
"configuration": {
  "theme": {
    "palette": {
      "primary": { "main": "#311b92" },
      "secondary": { "main": "#0097a7" },
      "tertiary": { "main": "#f57c00" },
      "quaternary": { "main": "#d50000" }
    }
  }
}
```

See [coloring/theming](/docs/config_guides/theme) for logos, fonts, and dark
mode.

### Loading a plugin {#loading-a-plugin}

Extra plugins (new track types, adapters, or the jexl color/detail functions
from the recipes above) load from a top-level `plugins` array. Use `esmLoc` for
a file next to your config, or `esmUrl` for one hosted elsewhere:

```json
"plugins": [
  { "name": "MyPlugin", "esmLoc": { "uri": "myplugin.js" } }
]
```

See [plugins](/docs/config_guides/plugins) for the UMD form and the published
plugin store.

### Opening to a specific view on load

`defaultSession` opens JBrowse at a region with tracks already showing, the same
slot used in the [TL;DR config](#tldr-a-complete-config-on-one-screen) above:

```json
"defaultSession": {
  "name": "My session",
  "views": [
    {
      "type": "LinearGenomeView",
      "init": {
        "loc": "ctgA:1000-2000",
        "assembly": "volvox",
        "tracks": ["genes", "coverage"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

See [default session](/docs/config_guides/default_session), and
[URL params](/docs/urlparams) for linking to a view without editing the config.

---

## Building many tracks from a samplesheet

`config.json` is plain JSON, so once you have more than a handful of similar
tracks (an RNA-seq timecourse, a ModENCODE-style panel, anything a pipeline
emits one file per sample for) the sane approach is to generate it with a small
script instead of hand-writing each track. A `MultiWiggleAdapter`'s
`subadapters` array is just a list, so it lines up one row per sample with the
kind of metadata table a workflow like Nextflow already produces:

```js
const samples = [
  { name: 't0', uri: 's3://foo/RNAseq/timecourse_t0.bw', color: '#1f77b4' },
  { name: 't1', uri: 's3://foo/RNAseq/timecourse_t1.bw', color: '#ff7f0e' },
  { name: 't2', uri: 's3://foo/RNAseq/timecourse_t2.bw', color: '#2ca02c' },
]

const track = {
  type: 'MultiQuantitativeTrack',
  trackId: 'rnaseq_timecourse',
  name: 'RNA-seq timecourse',
  assemblyNames: ['hg38'],
  adapter: {
    type: 'MultiWiggleAdapter',
    subadapters: samples.map(s => ({
      type: 'BigWigAdapter',
      name: s.name,
      uri: s.uri,
      color: s.color,
    })),
  },
}
```

Push `track` onto your config's `tracks` array and write the result out. None of
this is JBrowse-specific tooling: read the samplesheet with whatever your
pipeline already uses (a Nextflow channel, a pandas frame, `jq`) and emit JSON
at the end. For a one-off from the shell instead, `jbrowse add-track --multiwig`
takes the same rows as a `.json` sources file, see the
[multi-signal recipe](#multiple-signals-on-one-track-each-its-own-color).

---

## From config to a URL

Say a colleague asks "can you show me that gene on the coverage track?" Rather
than a screenshot or a list of click-here-then-here steps, send a link that
opens JBrowse already pointed at the right place, with the right tracks turned
on.

That's what URL parameters are for. A link doesn't set up anything new. It just
refers to things your `config.json` already defines, by name. Here's a
stripped-down config:

```json
{
  "assemblies": [{ "name": "volvox", "...": "..." }],
  "tracks": [
    { "trackId": "genes", "...": "..." },
    { "trackId": "coverage", "...": "..." }
  ]
}
```

And here's a link that opens both of those tracks at a region:

```
https://host/jbrowse2/?config=config.json&assembly=volvox&loc=ctgA:1-50000&tracks=genes,coverage
```

Reading it left to right, every piece is just a value copied out of the config:

- `?config=config.json` - which config file to load.
- `&assembly=volvox` - the `name` of an entry in the config's `assemblies` list.
  (This is the assembly's name, not a track, a common mix-up.)
- `&loc=ctgA:1-50000` - where to navigate. A region like this, or a gene name if
  you've run `jbrowse text-index`.
- `&tracks=genes,coverage` - a comma-separated list of `trackId`s to turn on,
  taken straight from the `tracks` array.

Note that a link like this starts a **fresh** view and ignores any
`defaultSession` you configured. To jump to a different region within a curated
default session instead, add `&extendSession=true`. JBrowse keeps the session's
tracks and settings and only changes the location (and you can drop
`&assembly=`, since it comes from the session).

### Setting a track's color (or height) in the link

Everything above turns tracks _on_. To control how a track _looks_ from the link
too, list it as an object with a `displaySnapshot` (the same settings you'd put
in `displayDefaults`) instead of a plain `"genes"`:

```
&session=spec-{"views":[{"type":"LinearGenomeView","assembly":"volvox","loc":"ctgA:1-50000","tracks":[{"trackId":"genes","displaySnapshot":{"color":"green"}}]}]}
```

This opens the genes track colored green without changing the config. Anything
you'd write in `displayDefaults` (color, height, display type, score range)
works here too.

### Adding a whole track that isn't in the config

Add a track the config has never heard of with `&sessionTracks=`, which takes
the same track config objects as the config's `tracks` array. For example, drop
in a few features inline with a [`FromConfigAdapter`](#inline-data-no-files)
(handy for sharing a BLAST hit or a region of interest) straight from the URL
bar:

```
&sessionTracks=[{"type":"FeatureTrack","trackId":"url_track","name":"URL track","assemblyNames":["volvox"],"adapter":{"type":"FromConfigAdapter","features":[{"uniqueId":"1","refName":"ctgA","start":100,"end":200,"name":"Boris"}]}}]
```

For the full list of parameters, plus multi-view layouts, dotplots, synteny, and
the shareable encoded links the "Share" button produces, see the
[URL query parameter API](/docs/urlparams).

### The same view definition works everywhere

The view definition inside a session spec is the same shape
[a `defaultSession` takes](#opening-to-a-specific-view-on-load) and the same one
an embedded component passes to `createViewState`, so a view you work out in one
place drops into the others unchanged. [Automating JBrowse](/docs/automating)
covers this shared launch model, and
[Embedding JBrowse](/docs/tutorials/embed_linear_genome_view) shows the embedded
version.
