## Overview

<details open>
<summary>ConnectionManagementSessionMixin - Properties</summary>

#### property: connectionTrackConfigs

Persisted configs of connection tracks the user has opened, keyed by trackId.
Unlike `connectionInstances` (stripped from snapshots, holds the whole fetched
hub), this holds only the tracks in use, so an open connection track resolves
synchronously on session load without re-establishing the connection.

```ts
// type signature
type connectionTrackConfigs = IOptionalIType<IType<Record<string, ConnectionTrackConfigEntry>, Record<string, ConnectionTrackConfigEntry>, Record<...>>, [...]>
// code
connectionTrackConfigs: types.stripDefault(
        types.frozen<Record<string, ConnectionTrackConfigEntry>>(),
        {},
      )
```

#### property: connectionInstances

```ts
// type signature
type connectionInstances = IOptionalIType<IArrayType<IAnyType>, [undefined]>
// code
connectionInstances: types.stripDefault(
  types.array(pluginManager.pluggableMstType('connection', 'stateModel')),
  [],
)
```

<summary>ConnectionManagementSessionMixin - Getters</summary>

#### getter: connections

```ts
type connections = (ModelInstanceTypeProps<Record<string, any>> & { setSubschema(slotName: string, data: Record<string, unknown>): any; setSlot(slotName: string, value: unknown): void; } & IStateTreeNode<...>)[]
```

<summary>ConnectionManagementSessionMixin - Actions</summary>

#### action: captureConnectionTrack

Snapshot a just-opened connection track's config into `connectionTrackConfigs`
so it survives session reload. No-op if the track isn't connection-provided or
is already captured (edits go through `updateConnectionTrackConfig`).

```ts
type captureConnectionTrack = (trackId: string) => void
```

#### action: updateConnectionTrackConfig

Persist an edit to an opened connection track. The full config is stored (not a
delta): the connection's fetched "base" isn't present at load, so only a
complete config resolves synchronously.

```ts
type updateConnectionTrackConfig = (
  trackConf: Record<string, unknown> & { trackId: string },
) => void
```

#### action: pruneConnectionTrackConfig

Drop a connection track's persisted config once no open view still references
it, so the session doesn't accumulate closed tracks.

```ts
type pruneConnectionTrackConfig = (trackId: string) => void
```

#### action: hydrateConnection

Lazily establish a single connection by id if it isn't already live — used when
its category is expanded in the track selector. Fetches silently (no view launch
/ success snackbar); already-open tracks keep rendering from
`connectionTrackConfigs` meanwhile. Idempotent.

```ts
type hydrateConnection = (connectionId: string) => void
```

#### action: makeConnection

```ts
type makeConnection = (configuration: ModelInstanceTypeProps<Record<string, any>> & { setSubschema(slotName: string, data: Record<string, unknown>): any; setSlot(slotName: string, value: unknown): void; } & IStateTreeNode<...>, initialSnapshot?: any) => any
```

#### action: prepareToBreakConnection

```ts
type prepareToBreakConnection = (configuration: ModelInstanceTypeProps<Record<string, any>> & { setSubschema(slotName: string, data: Record<string, unknown>): any; setSlot(slotName: string, value: unknown): void; } & IStateTreeNode<...>) => [...] | undefined
```

#### action: breakConnection

```ts
type breakConnection = (configuration: ModelInstanceTypeProps<Record<string, any>> & { setSubschema(slotName: string, data: Record<string, unknown>): any; setSlot(slotName: string, value: unknown): void; } & IStateTreeNode<...>) => void
```

#### action: deleteConnection

```ts
type deleteConnection = (configuration: ModelInstanceTypeProps<Record<string, any>> & { setSubschema(slotName: string, data: Record<string, unknown>): any; setSlot(slotName: string, value: unknown): void; } & IStateTreeNode<...>) => any
```

#### action: addConnectionConf

```ts
type addConnectionConf = (connectionConf: ModelInstanceTypeProps<Record<string, any>> & { setSubschema(slotName: string, data: Record<string, unknown>): any; setSlot(slotName: string, value: unknown): void; } & IStateTreeNode<...>) => any
```

#### action: clearConnections

```ts
type clearConnections = () => void
```
