Visualizing Hi-C data can be performed with .hic files generated by the Juicebox
software suite. It uses the hic-straw module developed by the juicebox/igv.js
team to visualize it in JBrowse.

Currently configuration options are basic for Hi-C tracks, see
[the comprehensive config guide](/docs/config_guides/hic_track/) for info about
configuring Hi-C tracks.
