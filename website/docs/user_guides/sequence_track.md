import Figure from '../figure'

The sequence track shows the reference sequence and a three-frame translation.
If the view is horizontally flipped, the sequence is "reverse complemented" so
the bottom three translation frames go to the top, and the top frames go to the
bottom.

<Figure caption="The sequence track, with a positive strand gene for context, shows the start codon on the first exon in the top-three rows of the translation frame. The bottom panel shows the same view but with the view horizontally flipped, and the gene is now shown reversed and the start codon is in the bottom translation frames." src="/img/sequence_track.png" />
