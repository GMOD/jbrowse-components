import Figure from '../figure'

The "bookmark widget" can store lists of interesting regions that you might like
to easily revisit.

<Figure caption="Clicking and dragging on a region can be used to create a bookmark." src="/img/bookmark_widget.png"/>

The bookmark stores a list of single regions (chromosome, start, and end
coordinate), and clicking on the regions in the bookmark widget will launch a
linear genome view at that region.

You can also import a list of regions from a BED file.

You can add "notes" for your list of regions by double clicking on the label
field to easily "annotate" your datasets.
