Users can add plugins to their session using the in-app plugin store. The plugin
will be added to your "session" which can be shared with the share button (or if
you are an admin running the admin-server, then it will be added to the config
file).

This can add extra functions, tracks, or many other interesting features. For
example, if you add the CIVIC plugin, it will automatically add a track that
contains the CIVIC cancer gene annotations to hg19.

:::info Note

Not all plugins are directly useful from being added, and require hand-editing
of the configuration file to be useful. If you would like to use such a plugin
and do not have access to the configuration file, contact your administrator.
