We are excited to announce a new JBrowse 2 product:
[JBrowseR](https://gmod.github.io/JBrowseR/).
JBrowseR builds on top of the
[React component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view)
that we recently released.
Our React component inherits the general JBrowse 2 philosophy: it is
fully customizable and pluggable, like the core product.

The React component makes it very straightforward to embed a Linear
Genome View into a React app. However, this API can come with a steep
learning curve for bioinformaticians who may not be very familiar with
React. This is where JBrowseR comes in!

JBrowseR provides an R interface to the JBrowse 2 LGV React component.
Using JBrowseR, you can:

- Embed the JBrowse 2 genome browser in **R Markdown** documents and **Shiny** applications
- Deploy a genome browser directly from the R console to view your data
- Customize your genome browser to display your own data

With this functionality, you can deploy a first-class genome browser with your data in just a few lines of R code!
