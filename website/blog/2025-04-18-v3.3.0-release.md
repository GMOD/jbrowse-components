Hello all,

This release adds a significant update to the multi-variant renderer that allows
it to be used for visualizing structural variants Previously, all variants >10bp
were filtered out, with the idea that overlapping variants are too difficult to
interpret

This PR now allows drawing large structural variants in the multi-sample variant
display type. It will actually draw long, even overlapping, structural variants!

Figure: Screenshot showing many SV calls over a 5Mbp+ region from the 3,202
human samples from the 1000 genomes project, with a large "inversion" variant
showing the shaded triangles. The right side panel shows the feature details for
this inversion variant showing the new genotype frequency panel, indicating
about 47% of samples have a 'heterozygous' inversion call here

Loading a random track, and turning on the arc display, there are indications of
a large variant for a random sample here (green and navy arcs indicate
discordant read pairing associated with inversion)

We hope that you enjoy these new features! The visualizations may be visually
complex but we hope it can be a magnifying glass to reveal important patterns of
your datasets! Feel free to let us know if you have any feedback
