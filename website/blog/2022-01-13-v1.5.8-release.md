title: v1.5.8 Release
date: 2022-01-13 03:02:09

---

This release fixes an important issue where @jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view
and other embedded packages did not work with v1.5.5 due to a babel
misconfiguration apologies to all affected!

Also we now can access the parent feature in jexl callbacks with parent(feature)
or get(feature, 'parent') which is often needed when coloring subfeatures like
exon/CDS features

This release also was made because v1.5.6 and v1.5.7 only were half-published to
npm, so v1.5.8 fixes it here
