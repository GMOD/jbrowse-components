Hello all,

This release includes a new ability to provide simplified snapshots to the
linear genome view, a new built-in clustering method for genotypes, and more

## In-app clustering

In recent versions, we provided the ability to cluster genotype and multi-wiggle
tracks, however we provided an R script for users to perform clustering
externally and import the results

With this release, we have added a basic in-app clustering workflow, greatly
improving the ease-of-use of this feature

## Renamed embedded packages and restored vanillajs builds

We have renamed our embedded packages

- Renamed @jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view ->
  @jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view2
- Renamed @jbrowse/react-circular-genome-view ->
  @jbrowse/react-circular-genome-view2
- Renamed @jbrowse/react-app -> @jbrowse/react-app2

Motivation: our vanillajs builds, which people often pointed to the "latest"
release on from CDN networks, were no longer able to be updated in a backwards
compatible way.

Therefore, we have renamed the packages, and updated tutorials.

This allows us to continue updating the package without any breakage for
existing users. Please let us know if you run into any issues!
