Hello, we are happy to release v2.2.1!

This contains several improvements including

- Ability to display the reference sequence track as a "GC content" track
- Ability to view SyntenyTracks as a plain track on a regular linear genome
  view, and to create synteny views from this

It also contains two important bug fixes

- In v2.2.0 CRAM features did not display mismatches correctly on alignments
  tracks
- In v2.2.0 the LGV ImportForm froze when changing assemblies that had the same
  refnames

We recommend upgrading to fix these issues!

Here are some screenshots of the new features in this release as well
