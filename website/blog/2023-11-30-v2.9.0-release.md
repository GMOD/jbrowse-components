This release adds a new feature for keeping track of your "Recently used tracks"
and tagging "Favorite tracks" . This will be valuable especially to users and
organizations who have large tracklists!

We also added the ability to load "single file hubs" from UCSC. These must be
manually pasted in the "Add connection" but in the future, we may add ability to
auto-load the hubs via the URL bar or similar. You can find a large amount of
these single file hubs from GenArk! https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/hubs/

Finally, this release also fixes an issue people saw with auto-updates for
JBrowse Desktop on Mac failing.
