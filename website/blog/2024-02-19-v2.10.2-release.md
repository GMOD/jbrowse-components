## Get stack traces from error messages

This release adds a new feature to allow getting the stack trace from error
messages, which will show the exact line of code the error occurred on and will
help with debugging error reports.

## Launch breakpoint split view from alignment feature details

Previously, you could launch a breakpoint split view from a TRA/breakend type
feature in the variant feature details, but this allows you to do it directly
via a read

## @jbrowse/img tool fixes

The jb2export command line image exporter from @jbrowse/img had issues with
node.js preventing it from running, so this was fixed, and a new ability to
export just snpcov visualizations was added. Example

```bash
jb2export --bam file.bam snpcov height:400 --fasta hg19.fa --out output.png
```
