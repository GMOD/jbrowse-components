## New multi-variant display modes

- Supports both large 1000 genomes style VCF or smaller trio VCF
- Allows users to cluster rows by genotype using a call out to R script

## Major improvements to the spreadsheet and SV inspector views

- Allows opening tracks in the spreadsheet and SV inspector

- Uses @mui/x-data-grid for display of the spreadsheet
- Makes separate columns for VCF INFO fields
- Support larger files by storing data in 'volatile' storage that doesn't bog
  down the session
- Support DEL, INV, and all types of SVs instead of just TRA and BND type
  variants in the SV inspector
- Re-navigates existing breakpoint split view instead of launching a new one
  each time

inspector

## Saves user sessions in a local IndexedDB

- Sessions are saved in IndexedDB instead of localStorage which has much higher
  capacity and organization, so you won't lose your sessions if your web browser
  closes!
- Users can create "favorite" sessions to revisit for later
- Admins can also create pre-configured sessions for their instance for users

sessions, and pre-configured sessions

## Improved "aborting" behavior

This is an ongoing refactor, but there is now new improved 'aborting' behavior
reducing some of the re-calculations that bog down the UI.

## Optimized and improved jbrowse-plugin-gwas

- New optimizations added for loading large GWAS style BED datasets to enable
  better jbrowse-plugin-gwas features
- The jbrowse-plugin-gwas also added a better clickmap allowing you to see the
  mouse-over feature https://github.com/cmdcolin/jbrowse-plugin-gwas
