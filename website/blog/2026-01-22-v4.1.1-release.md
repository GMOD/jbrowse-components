title: v4.1.1 Release

Hello all, This is a minor release but contains a couple great new features, and
some important bugfixes. Please see the release notes below

## Local files are preserved even after page refresh in jbrowse-web

When users of jbrowse-web open files from their local machine, it can continue
to work after page refresh. This is currently a Chrome only feature facilitated
by the FileSystemFileHandle API
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystemFileHandle

## Add linkage disequilibrium viewer

In an effort to expand the utility of our variant visualization capabilities, we
integrated a built-in linkage disequilibrium viewer for multi-sample variant
tracks. This can load data from multi-sample variant files or PLINK output
files. This can plot r^2 and D' with a variety of visual customization options
