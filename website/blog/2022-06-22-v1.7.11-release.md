We are excited to announce v1.7.11!

This release has some relatively small fixes to the UI, docs, and examples. For
developers, they may notice that we have removed `node-canvas` due to it's need
for having extra system dependencies, and because it only really was needed in
niche circumstances. This will improve the ease of installing packages like
`@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view`.
