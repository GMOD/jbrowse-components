Hi everyone, This is a big release on many fronts! Here are some highlights

## JBrowse 2 genome hubs https://genomes.jbrowse.org

We created a new website at https://genomes.jbrowse.org that features new
JBrowse 2 instances for over 50,000 species. This massive effort is primarily
driven by bulk loading data curated by the UCSC genome browser team, both their
main browsers and GenArk hubs, which have data for thousands of NCBI RefSeq
(curated) and GenBank genomes

All of these JBrowse 2 instances are available on both the web and on the
desktop app

Users can even browse "synteny views" between the different hubs by opening a
liftOver track, see https://genomes.jbrowse.org/demos/ for example

## Synteny and dotplot viewer improvements

We added some new features to the dotplot and synteny view, including:

- Opacity/transparency slider
- Min length slider
- Easy picker for new color schemes
- Auto-diagonalization to reorder chromosomes
- "Location markers" for helping see where you are in large alignments

alignments

## Draw amino acids on Gene glyphs

The setting "Color by CDS" added the ability to draw amino acid letters (and was
thus renamed "Color by CDS and draw amino acids").

This can help with detailed investigations of protein structures, which is an
area we are actively developing (see https://github.com/GMOD/proteinbrowser for
more information)

## Create 'Linked read display' for Alignments tracks

Users can now see paired-end reads and supplementary alignments as linked
entities using the "Linked reads display". This can be particularly useful for
structural variant inspection.

We included a variety of specialized options to help users dig into their data,
including:

- Show/hide proper pairs
- Show/hide 'singletons' (reads without pairs or supplementary alignments)
- Coloring schemes that highlight misoriented pairs and abnormally large insert
  sizes
- And more

Screenshot showing the "Linked reads display" with PacBio, Nanopore, and
Illumina paired-end reads. The long reads with split alignments are colored
salmon and light blue so that you can see the flip in orientation from positive
to negative, and back to positive again. The short paired-end reads are colored
navy and green to show the misoriented pairs

## Improved modified reads plotting

Some of the code for handling modifications was given a fresh refactor, which
fixed bugs with 'duplex' data where modifications are stored on both a positive
and negative pass on the same read

Here is an example of a screenshot showing chromatin accessibility via
introduced 6mA methylation from a Nanopore dataset (source:
https://epi2me.nanoporetech.com/chromatin-acc-hg002/)
