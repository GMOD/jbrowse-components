title: v1.0.2 Release
date: 2020-12-02
tags: ['release', 'jbrowse 2']
---

This release addresses two main issues:

- A bug introduced in v1.0.1 where the CLI command `jbrowse create` would not
  download the latest version of JBrowse Web.
- A fix for a problem that prevented `@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view` (first
  released in v1.0.1) from working properly.

Several other bug fixes and improvements are also included. See details below.

## Downloads
