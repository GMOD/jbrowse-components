## Allow user to draw only matches in synteny view

The synteny view can display long alignments, including insertions and
deletions. However, particularly in chain files, the specific
"insertion/deletion" markers are less meaningful as a large insertion+deletion
pair is often used to connect more high-scoring alignments across large
distances

## Removal of the "Start screen" from jbrowse-web

This release removes the "start screen" from jbrowse-web. Instead of showing the
start screen, users are just dropped straight into the main jbrowse 2 interface.
This will hopefully "drop users into the action" faster.

## Bug fixes

Some notable bug fixes include

- Fix for loading bigwig files created by
  [`bigtools`](https://github.com/jackh726/bigtools) (a newer Rust-based bigwig
  toolkit)
- Fix for certain breakpoint split view workflows fetching too much data and
  freezing

Feel free to let us know if you have any feedback
