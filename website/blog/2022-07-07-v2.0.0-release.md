We are pleased to release v2.0.0! This is a major version milestone, but it does
not have a huge number of changes. Instead, the major change that resulted in
becoming v2.0.0 was the upgrade of many of our dependencies including

- material-ui v4 -> v5
- mobx-state-tree v3.14.1 -> v5
- mobx-react v6 -> v7
- mobx v5 -> v6

Therefore, to help users that may have been relying on library versions like
this, it is safer to make the version a major bump. If you run into any issues
with this upgrade, let us know and we can help

Some notable improvements:

- This release improves bundle sizes for users of embedded components, by adding
  ESM builds to NPM. This can reduce the initial load of a webpage using e.g.
  @jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view by about 55% (1.4MB gzipped js->770kb
  gzipped js)
