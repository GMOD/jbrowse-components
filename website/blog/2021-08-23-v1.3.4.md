We're excited to announce the v1.3.5 release of JBrowse! Some highlights of this
release include:

## New embedding build of `@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view`

This release adds a new UMD build of our
[`@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view)
React component. This build will allow users to use our React Linear Genome View
in a website that doesn't otherwise use React. See a tutorial for how to get
started using this build:

- https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/tutorials/embed_linear_genome_view/01_introduction

A preliminary beta version of this build was used in a tutorial at BOSC2020, and
that tutorial was also on our website. If you've used that version, the
interface has changed somewhat, so come check out the new tutorial for the
official released version!

## Bookmark widget

A new widget has been added that is accessible from the Linear Genome View view
menu or when you click and drag over a region in the header (a.k.a rubber band
selection). This view keeps a list of bookmarked regions, which you can add
custom labels to, and also which you can use to navigate back to that region.
The bookmarks can also be exported.

## Note to plugin developers

If your plugin adds menu items or context menu items to a track, or customizes
`renderProps`, there may be some changes that affect how those menu items work,
particularly in [#2226](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/pull/2226)
and [#2229](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/pull/2229). Also see an
updated example of context menu items
[here](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/developer_guide#adding-track-context-menu-items).
