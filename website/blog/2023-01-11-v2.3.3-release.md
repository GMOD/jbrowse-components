Hello all,

This release refactored a number of things with the synteny view that should
improve performance. This refactoring also enabled self-vs-self alignments to be
rendered by the linear synteny view which previously was not supported.

We also fixed the desktop app not being able to auto-update in v2.2.2-v2.3.2. If
you are on one of these versions for JBrowse Desktop, please manually download
this release to get back into the auto-update stream :)
