We're excited to announce the v1.4.4 release! Some highlights of this release
include:

## Text searching

Finally, we have added the ability to search by gene name!

Users will now be able to create their own text indexes with the `jbrowse text-index` command, which creates an index for searching by gene names, identifiers and descriptions.

Try it out yourself here, type your favorite gene name e.g. HER2, PTEN, or others in the search box https://jbrowse.org/code/jb2/v1.4.4/?config=test_data%2Fconfig_demo.json&session=share-H3vwqh1BKa&password=xYz9Z

For a quick introduction and a tutorial on how to add this feature to your JBrowse instance, check out this [quick start](/docs/quickstart_cli#indexing-feature-names-for-searching)

Like most parts of JBrowse, the text searching system is pluggable. Plugin developers can add new text index adapters to connect JBrowse to other types of text search services, indexes, or databases.

Users of the @jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view can also enable text searching functionality, see https://jbrowse.org/storybook/lgv/v1.4.0/?path=/story/text-searching--page

Note that 1.4.0-1.4.3 had issues during publish, so we moved all release notes for them to here. Thanks to @bbimber for letting us know about these issues.
