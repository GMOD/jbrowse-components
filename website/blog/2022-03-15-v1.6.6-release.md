We are pleased to release v1.6.6!

This contains several updated synteny features, including:

- load .chain files from UCSC
- load .delta files from mummer
- load .anchors and .anchors.simple files from MCScan from the GUI
- ability to "rectangularize" the dotplot view and improved dotplot view
  overviews (shows total bp of selected regions)

pairs) and .anchors.simple (black, larger synteny blocks) files from MCScan
shown in the dotplot view

Note: MCScan functionality existed internally but was not easy to use. The
configuration schema for MCScan anchors files changed also to load the .bed
files at startup. See the config guide for details

We also have an updated configuration editor GUI with collapsible sections

A number of alignments track look and feel improvements were also added. The
scale bar was made to just list the min and max values when the height is small,
clip indicator position when horizontally flipped was fixed, and the headroom
was removed making the snpcoverage take up the full height of the small area it
uses.

There have also been some changes to how internet accounts work. If you use one
of the built-in accounts like Google Drive or Dropbox, there's no need to change
anything. If you've implemented your own internet account, though, see
[#2725](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/pull/2725) for more details.
