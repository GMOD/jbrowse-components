This release contains important fixes for drawing base-level synteny based on
CIGAR strings, especially in inverted regions. We also fixed refName renaming
(e.g. your BAM file has 'chr1' but the FASTA has '1') on the new arc display
(see v2.3.1).

Additionally, it offers the ability to reverse/complement the sequence in the
"Get sequence" dialog.

Screenshot showing how insertions from relative to one assembly exactly match up
at a "deletion" relative to another, using the LGV synteny display and curved
arcs. Previous versions had bugs but will now match exactly.
