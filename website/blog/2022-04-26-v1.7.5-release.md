We are pleased to present the release of v1.7.5

This release includes two major improvements

- Ability to index tracks for searching by gene names in JBrowse Desktop. This
  let's users choose per-track indexes in the add track widget interactively, or
  index them after-the-fact using the track menu.
- Removed serialization of BAM/CRAM features for pileup tracks which brings
  large performance benefits for jbrowse-web and jbrowse-desktop. Previously,
  all the BAM/CRAM features were serialized across the RPC boundary in
  jbrowse-web and jbrowse-desktop, but this was an expensive and memory
  intensive operation. Now, the BAM/CRAM features are not serialized, but the
  main thread has to manually request any data it needs from the worker after
  rendering (e.g. when we click a feature).

with v1.7.4, which brings the webworker performance in line with the embedded
app (which does no serialization)

This release also fixes a bug with using trix indexes created by
`jbrowse text-index` in v1.7.0-v1.7.4 (with the adjustable prefix size)
