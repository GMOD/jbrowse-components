# JBrowse 2 download

To get started with JBrowse 2, we recommend using the "jbrowse CLI"

Run

```
npm install -g @jbrowse/cli
jbrowse create jbrowse_folder
```

This will download the latest jbrowse to a folder called jbrowse_folder

If you have a server with apache or nginx, you can then

```
mv jbrowse_folder /var/www/html/jbrowse2
```

Then your instance will be available from http://localhost/jbrowse2

See [the quickstart guide](../docs/quickstart_web) for more info on loading tracks and getting started

You can also manually download this release as a zip file from GitHub here
