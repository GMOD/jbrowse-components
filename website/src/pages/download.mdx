# JBrowse 2 download

To get started with JBrowse 2, we recommend using the "jbrowse CLI"

Run

```
npm install -g @jbrowse/cli
jbrowse create jbrowse_folder
```

This will download the latest jbrowse to a folder called jbrowse_folder

If you have a server with apache or nginx, you can then

```
mv jbrowse_folder /var/www/html/jbrowse2
```

Then your instance will be available from http://localhost/jbrowse2

If you use some other custom system, such as django, follow steps to host your
content in your static folder

Note: this folder is a "static website compatible" content, containing just JS,
CSS, and no server side scripts, so Amazon s3 any static site hosting can be
used as an alternative

See [the quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart_web) for more info on loading tracks and getting started

You can also manually download this release as a zip file from GitHub here
