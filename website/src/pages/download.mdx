You can also use the jbrowse CLI for things like adding tracks too.

guide](/docs/quickstart_web) for setting up JBrowse Web.

## JBrowse 2 embedded components

We also have our embedded components, such as
@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view, which is the React component for the linear
genome browser view (no circular, dotplot, etc).

See https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view for
instructions on downloading this with npm or yarn.
