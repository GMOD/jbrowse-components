![](./img/dotplot.png)
A genome vs genome dotplot displayed in the DotplotView. This displays grape vs
peach genomes via PAF file

---

![](./img/linear_synteny.png)
A linear synteny display for grape vs peach displayed in the LinearSyntenyView
via MCScan anchors file results

---

![](./img/alignments_sort_by_base.png)
Shows sorting the alignments pileup by the base-pair-at-the-given-position in
the AlignmentsTrack

---

![](./img/hic_track.png)
Shows rendering of a .hic file type in the HicTrack

---

![](./img/sv_inspector_importform_loaded.png)
Screenshot of the SV inspector displaying inter-chromosomal translocations in
the SKBR3 cell line. The SV inspector is a spreadsheet view plus whole-genome
circular overview of the SVs

---

![](./img/horizontally_flip.png)
Shows the ability to horizontally flip the current view. This allows the
anti-sense strand to be read left to right

---

![](./img/linear_longread.png)
Using the synteny view to render a long-read vs the reference genome. This is
available simply by clicking an alignments feature and selecting "Linear read
vs ref"

---

![](./img/dotplot_longread.png)
Using the dotplot view to render a long-read vs the reference genome. This is
available by right-clicking an alignments feature and selecting "Dotplot read
vs ref"

---

![](./img/cnv.png)
This is a whole-genome overview of CNV data using a BigWig file of
read-coverage depth. This uses the XYPlot, with fill turned off. The BigWig
data is binned at this resolution, and the blue shades represent the min, mean,
and max value in each bin

![](./img/breakpoint_split_view.png)
Image of the "breakpoint split view" which examines the breakpoints of a
structural variant, e.g. an interchromosomal translocation, and connects
supporting reads (black splines) and the variant call itself (green thicker
line, with feet indicating directionality)
