Footnotes:

[^1] jbrowse-desktop is our desktop app, and can be downloaded and run on your
computer with no server setup. jbrowse-web is our web product, and can be
downloaded and used on your website.

[^2] you can also use the [jbrowse
CLI](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/quickstart_web) to automatically install or
upgrade your jbrowse 2 instance

[^3] Both jbrowse-web and jbrowse-desktop are versioned independently so this
release might not share the same version number
