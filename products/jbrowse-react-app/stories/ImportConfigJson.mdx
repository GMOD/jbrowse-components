## Importing config.json files

The jbrowse-web app is coded in such a way that it will fetch a config.json file
from the current directory (or wherever is specified by the URL ?config=
parameter). The @jbrowse/react-app does not do this however, and makes no
assumptions about URL parameters, so a developer must hand-code this themselves.
This is typical of low level components, the developer gains more control over
the app but must implement some things themselves

## Example 1. Using 'static json imports'

<Story of={WithImportConfigJson} />

## Example 2. Using 'fetch' to get the config.json

<Story of={WithFetchConfigJson} />
