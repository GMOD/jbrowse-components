# Welcome!

This site contains the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) docs for the
[JBrowse 2 React App Component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jbrowse/react-app).
The component makes it possible to embed the full JBrowse 2 application (with
all the bells and whistles) in any React application.

## Using the docs

This is an example of using the @jbrowse/react-app as a component:

<Story of={BasicExample} />

You can test out the various features of the component, and open tracks and
interact with it as you would in your app. You can also click on the code button
on the bottom right to see what the code looks like for the component being
viewed.

## An overview of the @jbrowse/react-app API

The @jbrowse/react-app component (or "app component") relies on the same
[configuration](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/config_guide) as the main JB2 app

The createViewState constructor accepts a config object just like a config.json
that you would pass to @jbrowse/web. It is not programmed to fetch the
config.json so you can fetch the config.json manually if you want to fetch it
from a file

Config structure:

```json
{
  "configuration": {
    /* global configs here */
  },
  "assemblies": [
    /* list of assembly configurations, e.g. the genomes being viewed */
  ],
  "tracks": [
    /* array of tracks being loaded, contain reference to which assembl(y/ies)
    they belong to */
  ],
  "defaultSession": {
    /* optional default session */
  }
}
```

## Additional resources

This overview is intended as a launching point for initial use of the
@jbrowse/react-app component. Make sure to check out the rest of the stories to
get a better feel for what is possible with the component.
