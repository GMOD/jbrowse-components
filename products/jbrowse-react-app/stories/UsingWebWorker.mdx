<Meta title="Using WebWorker RPC" />

## Web Worker RPC

Developers can configure their instance of `@jbrowse/react-app` to use web
workers by importing `makeWorkerInstance` and adding the `WebWorkerRpcDriver`
configuration to `createViewState`, the app will use the WebWorker RPC

Using WebWorker RPC can greatly reduce "hanging" of the main thread browsing
alignments datasets like BAM / CRAM.

[See our create-react-app v5 demo project for example using web worker](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/embedded_components/)

## Example

## Note 1

It may be important to use `"publicPath":"auto"` for your webpack config to
properly resolve the web workers
[(see this issue for webpack)](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/13791#issuecomment-897579223)
in create-react-app

## Note 2

The web worker functionality is not enabled by default because it requires your
bundler to understand the `new Worker` construct, which not all bundlers
support, but we do recommend using it if you are able to as it can improve speed
and user experience. Link for `webpack` support of `new Worker` syntax,
[see here](https://webpack.js.org/guides/web-workers/)
