# protein-widget technology preview

This is a technology preview of a special-purpose embedded browser built
with JBrowse 2 components.

It isn't released or maintained, but does demonstrate how these components
can be re-mixed and integrated to make different things.

# To run it

```bash
cd jbrowse-components
yarn
cd products/jbrowse-protein-widget
yarn
yarn start
```

# To make a packaged build

```bash
yarn build
```
