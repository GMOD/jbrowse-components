macOS Entitlements for JBrowse Desktop
======================================

The entitlements.plist file declares permissions needed to run with Apple's
"hardened runtime" security feature, which is required for notarization.

Entitlements:

  allow-jit
    Allows V8/Chromium's JavaScript JIT compiler to work. Required for Electron.

  allow-unsigned-executable-memory
    Allows creating writable+executable memory. Also required for V8's JIT.

  disable-library-validation
    Allows loading dynamic libraries without signature checks. Needed for
    native Node modules.

  network.client
    Allows outbound network connections. JBrowse needs this to fetch remote
    genomic data.

  files.user-selected.read-write
    Allows reading/writing files the user picks via file dialogs. Needed to
    open local genome files.

When it's used:

  Only during macOS builds when APPLE_ID is set. The packager passes it to
  codesign via the --entitlements flag.
