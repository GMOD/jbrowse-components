# Default sessions

When using JBrowse 2, information about the current app state such
as what views are open is stored in a session.
It is possible to configure a JB2 app with a `defaultSession`, which
will be loaded when the app first is loaded.

## Creating a default session

It is possible to manually configure a `defaultSession` for a React LGV
component. Here is the default structure:

```js
const defaultSession = {
  name: 'My session',
  view: {
    id: 'linearGenomeView',
    type: 'LinearGenomeView',
    tracks: [
      {
        // the first track displayed
      },
      {
        // the second track displayed
      },
      {
        // ...
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

The general outline for a track looks like this:

```js
{
  type: '{the type of the track}',
  configuration: '{the id of the track}',
  displays: [
    {
      type: '{the type of the display}',
      configuration:
        '{id of the track}-{the type of the display}',
    },
  ],
},
```

For example, to display a ReferenceSequenceTrack with the id `GRCh38-ReferenceSequenceTrack`,
the track configuration would be:

```js
{
  type: 'ReferenceSequenceTrack',
  configuration: 'GRCh38-ReferenceSequenceTrack',
  displays: [
    {
      type: 'LinearReferenceSequenceDisplay',
      configuration:
        'GRCh38-ReferenceSequenceTrack-LinearReferenceSequenceDisplay',
    },
  ],
}
```

## Exporting sessions

A powerful tool for learning about track types and display types for default sessions is
the feature for exporting sessions in the main JBrowse 2 app (File > Export session).
This feature exports a JSON file of the current session in the app.
This feature can also be used to graphically generate the desired view configuration for the
React LGV component.

To create a default session using JB2, load whatever tracks and data you want to be displayed
into a session with a single linear genome view open. Export the session from JB2 and save
it as `session.json` in your app.

To use the view settings in your app, you can create the `defaultSession` like this:

```js
import session from './session.json'

const defaultSession = {
  name: 'My Session',
  view: session.session.views[0],
}
```

Here is an example LGV with a long reads alignment track loaded in the `defaultSession`:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="linear-view--with-long-reads" />
</Canvas>
