## Using plugins

You can use extra load a plugin at runtime for the embedded component.

This can come in the form of

- Plugins loaded a build time
- Plugins loaded at runtime

The build time would be installed from NPM and included in your source code for
setting up the components. The runtime ones would load e.g. from a URL, and
you'd also write some code to load those. This example shows runtime, but a
small source code comment in this example shows how build time would be used
too
