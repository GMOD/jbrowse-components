## Using plugins

You can use extra load a plugin at runtime for the embedded component.

This example loads a plugin that is defined in your own source code. The plugin
adds an extra action from clicking and dragging a region with the mouse that
console.log's the region that was selected

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="linear-view--with-inline-plugins" />
</Canvas>

This example loads a plugin from an external URL

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="linear-view--with-external-plugins" />
</Canvas>
