## Example showing two linear genome views on the same page

This page of course has more than two instances, but this is just a quick code
snippet to demonstrate

<Canvas>
  <Story id="linear-view--two-linear-genome-views" />
</Canvas>

## Demo showing that outside styles don't conflict with the component

The react component takes measures to avoid being affected by styles outside of
it on the page. In this case, a font and a text align, which without measures
could affect the jbrowse-react-linear-genome-view component, is fine here.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="linear-view--with-outside-styling" />
</Canvas>
