# Welcome!

This site contains the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) docs for the
[JBrowse 2 React Linear Genome View Component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view).
The component makes it possible to embed an interactive genome browser in any
React application.
The Storybook docs make it possible to provide an interactive demonstration of
how the component looks and works.

## Using the docs

This is an example of what a story looks like:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="linear-view--one-linear-genome-view" />
</Canvas>

You can test out the various features of the component, and open tracks and
interact with it as you would in your app. You can also click on the code
button on the bottom right to see what the code looks like for the component
being viewed.

## An overview of the LGV API

The LGV component relies on the same
[configuration](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/config_guide) as the main JB2 app,
with a few noteworthy differences.

First, the component can be configured using a standalone JSON file like JB2,
or can be configured with JavaScript objects in the source code of the app
where it is being used, as shown
[here](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/blob/HEAD/products/jbrowse-react-linear-genome-view/docs/example.md).

Second, while this is the structure of a JB2 configuration file:

```json
{
  "configuration": {
    /* global configs here */
  },
  "assemblies": [
    /* list of assembly configurations, e.g. the genomes being viewed */
  ],
  "tracks": [
    /* array of tracks being loaded, contain reference to which assembl(y/ies)
    they belong to */
  ],
  "defaultSession": {
    /* optional default session */
  }
}
```

The LGV component only accepts a single assembly object instead of an array:

```json
{
  "assembly": {
    /* the assembly being used for the browser */
  }
}
```

You can also set an initial location for when the browser first loads on the package
when you initialize the state of the component with your configuration values:

```js
const state = createViewState({
  assembly,
  tracks,
  location: '10:29,838,737..29,838,819',
  defaultSession,
})
```

Example

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="linear-view--using-loc-object" />
</Canvas>
