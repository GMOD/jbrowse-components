# Internet accounts

"Internet accounts" are used to access authenticated resources or otherwise
override the 'fetch' behavior of the app. Starting with v2.2.1 of
`@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view`, developers can use InternetAccounts in the
embedded components.

## Using InternetAccounts

InternetAccount configurations are passed to `createViewState` like this:

```js
const state = createViewState({
  assembly,
  tracks,
  location: 'ctgA:1105..1221',
  internetAccounts: [
    {
      type: 'ExternalTokenInternetAccount',
      internetAccountId: 'manualGoogleEntry',
      name: 'Google Drive Manual Token Entry',
      description: 'Manually enter a token to access Google Drive files',
      tokenType: 'Bearer',
    },
  ],
})
```

Then any file location in your tracks that specifies an `internetAccountId` of
"manualGoogleEntry" will use the specified InternetAccount.

The above example lets the user manually enter a token already retrieved
elsewhere. An "Authorization" header is then set on any request to that resource
with a value of `Bearer <token>`.

## Notes

Normally, internet accounts are used for accessing information from external
third party resources. For accessing authenticated non-external resources,
you'll more likely be 'automatically' be authenticated via cookies.

Note that JBrowse's `DropboxOAuthInternetAccount` and
`GoogleDriveOAuthInternetAccount` will not work as-is because
`@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view` doesn't have the app-level control needed to
properly execute an OAuth 2.0 login flow.

There are some instances where InternetAccounts could be useful for non-external
resources too though. For example, you can use a custom InternetAccount to
override the `fetch` behavior of a particular track, allowing you to customize
where and how the data is retrieved.
