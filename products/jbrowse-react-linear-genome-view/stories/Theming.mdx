## Theming

Users can customize various aspects by providing a theme. We have a concept of
"primary","secondary",and "tertiary", and "quaternary" colors for the app which
by default are "dark blue", "purple", and "yellow". This example changes those,
as well as the colors used for the DNA bases.

See [here](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/config_guides/theme/) for more info

## Dark theme

Basic effort was made to make JBrowse dark mode compatible. This can be toggled
via the 'mode':'dark' in the theme palette
