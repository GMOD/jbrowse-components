# Default tracks

You can specify a set of default tracks to open using defaultTracks. This will
be overridden by the defaultSession if it is specified. Note also you can use
forceTracks, which will make the track display even if defaultSession is
specified.

Example with defaultTracks: just makes tracks specified from defaultTracks
displayed, no defaultSession used

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="linear-view--using-default-tracks" />
</Canvas>

Example with forceTracks: has a defaultSession and a forceTracks which makes
tracks from both entities displayed

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="linear-view--with-long-reads" />
</Canvas>
