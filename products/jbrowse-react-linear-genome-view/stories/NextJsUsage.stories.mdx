# Usage with Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a popular framework for building
server-rendered React websites with Node.js.
Given that the JB2 LGV React component is designed for use in static
apps, that are a few extra steps that need to be taken when using
the component in a Next.js app.

## Configuration

It is important to understand that in Next.js apps, webpack compilation
happens twice: once for the server and once for the client.
Because of this, the following additional webpack configuration needs
to be added to your `next.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
    // Fixes npm packages that depend on `fs` module
    if (!isServer) {
      config.node = {
        fs: 'empty',
      }
    }

    return config
  },
}
```

This resolves issues with how our data parsers work, since they are written
to work in either Node.js or in the browser.

## Dynamic imports

Some React components, such as the React LGV component are not written to
be compatible with server-side rendering, since they rely on APIs that exist
only in the browser.
For these types of components, it is necessary to use [dynamic imports](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import).

Here is an example of how to dynamically load a component using the JB2 component into a Next.js page:

```js
// In components/Browser.js

import {
  createViewState,
  createJBrowseTheme,
} from '@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view'

const assembly = {
  // configuration
}

const tracks = [
  // configuration
]

const defaultSession = {
  // configuration
}

function View() {
  const state = createViewState({
    assembly,
    tracks,
    location: '10:29,838,737..29,838,819',
    defaultSession,
  })
  return <JBrowseLinearGenomeView viewState={state} />
}

export default View
```

Then, in the page where the component is used:

```js
// in pages/index.js
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const Browser = dynamic(() => import('../components/Browser'), { ssr: false })

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Browser />
    </div>
  )
}
```
