      <p>
        This parent container has textAlign:&apos;center&apos; and a monospace
        font, but these attributes are not affecting the internal LGV
      </p>
      <p>
        The react component takes measures to avoid being affected by styles
        outside of it on the page. In this case, a font and a text align, which
        without measures could affect the jbrowse-react-linear-genome-view
        component, is fine here.
