## Web Worker RPC

Developers can configure their instance of @jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view to
use webworkers from v2.1.6 of jbrowse forward.

The code snippet looks this

```
import { createViewState, loadPlugins, JBrowseLinearGenomeView } from '@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view'
import makeWorkerInstance from '@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view/esm/makeWorkerInstance'

...
function YourApp() {
 const state = createViewState({
    assembly,
    tracks,
    location: 'ctgA:1105..1221',
    configuration: {
      rpc: {
        defaultDriver: 'WebWorkerRpcDriver',
      },
    },
    makeWorkerInstance,
  })

  return <JBrowseLinearGenomeView viewState={state} />
}

```

By importing makeWorkerInstance and adding the WebWorkerRpcDriver configuration
to createViewState, the app will use the WebWorker RPC

Using WebWorker RPC can greatly reduce "hanging" of the main thread browsing
alignments datasets like BAM / CRAM.

It may be important to use "publicPath":"auto" for your webpack config to
properly resolve the web workers
