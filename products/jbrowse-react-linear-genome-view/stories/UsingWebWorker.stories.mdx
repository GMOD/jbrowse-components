<Meta title="Using WebWorker RPC" />

## Web Worker RPC

Developers can configure their instance of @jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view to
use web workers from v2.1.6 forward.

By importing `makeWorkerInstance` and adding the `WebWorkerRpcDriver`
configuration to `createViewState`, the app will use the WebWorker RPC

Using WebWorker RPC can greatly reduce "hanging" of the main thread browsing
alignments datasets like BAM / CRAM.

It may be important to use `"publicPath":"auto"` for your webpack config to
properly resolve the web workers
https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/13791#issuecomment-897579223 in
create-react-app.

See our demo projects for more examples
https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/embedded_components/

Note: The web worker functionality is not enabled by default because it requires
your bundler to understand the `new Worker` construct, which not all bundlers
support, but we do recommend using it if you are able to as it can improve speed
and user experience. Link for `webpack` support of `new Worker` syntax
