## Web Worker RPC

Developers can configure their instance of @jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view to
use webworkers from v2.1.6 of jbrowse forward.

The code snippet looks this

```
import { createViewState, loadPlugins, JBrowseLinearGenomeView } from '@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view'
import makeWorkerInstance from '@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view/esm/makeWorkerInstance'

...
function YourApp() {
 const state = createViewState({
    assembly,
    tracks,
    location: 'ctgA:1105..1221',
    configuration: {
      rpc: {
        defaultDriver: 'WebWorkerRpcDriver',
      },
    },
    makeWorkerInstance,
  })

  return <JBrowseLinearGenomeView viewState={state} />
}

```

By importing makeWorkerInstance and adding the WebWorkerRpcDriver configuration
to createViewState, the app will use the WebWorker RPC

Using WebWorker RPC can greatly reduce "hanging" of the main thread browsing
alignments datasets like BAM / CRAM.

It may be important to use "publicPath":"auto" for your webpack config to
properly resolve the web workers
https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/13791#issuecomment-897579223 in
create-react-app. See our demo projects for more examples
https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/embedded_components/

The web worker functionality is not enabled by default because it requires your
bundler to understand the "new Worker" construct, which not all bundlers
support, but we do recommend using it if you are able to as it can improve speed
and user experience. Link for web pack support of new Worker syntax
