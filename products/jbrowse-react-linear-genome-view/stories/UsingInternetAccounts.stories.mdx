## Using InternetAccounts

Starting with v2.2.1 of `@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view`, developers can use
JBrowse's InternetAccounts in the component.

Before using InternetAccounts, make sure they are what you need for your
application. InternetAccounts in JBrowse Web are generally used for accessing
controlled files, e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox, and other password-protected
files. Often it will be better to handle this type of functionality in your app
and then run `@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view` in an part of your app that has
already been authenticated. In fact, JBrowse's DropboxOAuthInternetAccount and
GoogleDriveOAuthInternetAccount will not work as-is because
`@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view` doesn't have the app-level control needed to
properly execute an OAuth 2.0 login flow.

There are some instances where InternetAccounts could be useful, though. For
example, you can use a custom InternetAccount to override the `fetch` behavior
of a particular track, allowing you to customize where and how the data is
retrieved.

InternetAccount configurations are passed to `createViewState` like this:

```js
import {
  createViewState,
  loadPlugins,
  JBrowseLinearGenomeView,
} from '@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view'
import makeWorkerInstance from '@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view/esm/makeWorkerInstance'

function YourApp() {
  const state = createViewState({
    assembly,
    tracks,
    location: 'ctgA:1105..1221',
    internetAccounts: [
      {
        type: 'ExternalTokenInternetAccount',
        internetAccountId: 'manualGoogleEntry',
        name: 'Google Drive Manual Token Entry',
        description: 'Manually enter a token to access Google Drive files',
        tokenType: 'Bearer',
      },
    ],
  })

  return <JBrowseLinearGenomeView viewState={state} />
}
```

Then any file location in your tracks that specifies an `internetAccountId` of
"manualGoogleEntry" will use the specified InternetAccount. The above example
lets the user manually enter a token already retrieved elsewhere. An
"Authorization" header is then set on any request to that resource with a value
of `Bearer <token>`.
