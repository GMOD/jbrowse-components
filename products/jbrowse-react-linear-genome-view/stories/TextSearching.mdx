# Text searching

## Aggregate search index

An aggregate search index contains info for multiple tracks. This can be
configured by passing the "aggregateTextSearchAdapters" (which would normally
just be a single entry but could be multiple)

## Per-track search index

Per-track search indexes contain information for a single track.

# Preparing indexes

In embedded mode, preparing search indexes is a little more awkward because the
`jbrowse test-index` command normally looks for a config.json but embedded use
cases don't generally use the config.json. Therefore, you can supply the --file
argument to the `jbrowse text-index` command

### Preparing aggregate search indexes

If you use the `jbrowse text-index` command with the --files argument, you can
create an aggregate index. E.g.

```sh
jbrowse text-index --file file1.gff.gz --fileId trackid_of_file1 --file file2.vcf.gz --fileId track_id_of_file2
```

This will output a directory "trix" with aggregate.ix, aggregate.ixx, and
aggregate_meta.json which you can put into your embedded jbrowse config. The
`--file` argument is helpful since you may not have an actual config. The
argument to --fileId should ideally match the trackId you use at runtime.
Supplying the correct trackId to --fileId will allow the track to automatically
be opened when a user selects a search result

### Preparing per-track search indexes

Similar to the aggregate use case above, you can use `jbrowse-text-index` with
the --files argument, but if it is just a single file supplied e.g.

```
jbrowse text-index --file myfile.gff3.gz --fileId track_id_of_myfile
```

then it will create a myfile.gff3.gz.ix, myfile.gff3.gz.ixx and
myfile.gff3.gz_meta.json. The --file argument is helpful since you may not have
an actual config, and the --fileId is used to match the trackId you use for the
file at runtime

### Using a config file

You can also use jbrowse text-index on a config.json file that is used for e.g.
jbrowse-web in the embedded application, just copy the portions of the relevant
config e.g. the `aggregateTextSearchAdapters` section into the arguments to
`createViewState`
