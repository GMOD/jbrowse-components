# Welcome!

This site contains the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) docs for the
[JBrowse 2 React Circular Genome View Component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jbrowse/react-circular-genome-view).
The component makes it possible to embed an interactive genome browser in any
React application. The Storybook docs make it possible to provide an interactive
demonstration of how the component looks and works.

## Using the docs

This is an example of what a story looks like:

<Story of={Volvox} />

You can test out the various features of the component, and open tracks and
interact with it as you would in your app. You can also click on the code button
on the bottom right to see what the code looks like for the component being
viewed.

## An overview of the CGV API

The CGV component relies on the same
[configuration](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/config_guide) as the main JB2 app,
with a few noteworthy differences.

First, the component can be configured using a standalone JSON file like JB2, or
can be configured with JavaScript objects in the source code of the app where it
is being used, as shown
[here](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/blob/HEAD/products/jbrowse-react-circular-genome-view/docs/example.md).

Second, while this is the structure of a JB2 configuration file:

```json
{
  "configuration": {
    /* global configs here */
  },
  "assemblies": [
    /* list of assembly configurations, e.g. the genomes being viewed */
  ],
  "tracks": [
    /* array of tracks being loaded, contain reference to which assembl(y/ies)
    they belong to */
  ],
  "defaultSession": {
    /* optional default session */
  }
}
```

The CGV component only accepts a single assembly object instead of an array:

```json
{
  "assembly": {
    /* the assembly being used for the browser */
  }
}
```

## Opening up tracks by default

You can call "showTrack" on the object returned by createViewState

<Story of={ShowTrack} />

## Additional resources

This overview is intended as a launching point for initial use of the CGV
component. Make sure to check out the rest of the stories to get a better feel
for what is possible with the component.
